MarutiSuzuki;Swift;13 Aug 2020;Abu Baba;3.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;My diesel powered swift 2013 is probably the best hatchback car I have ever owned. The reason I say so is because even after driving it for more than 170000 kms, the car still feels fun to drive. Moreover it is an economic option with less service costs and average fuel economy I get of about 21 kmpl. Moreover Maruti's great after sales service experience, the quality of service/repairs offered an d vast network of service centers really helps. The only time I had to spend some money was in the events of tires and battery replacements. Although there are no high end features to brag about this car, the feature list is simply practical and just enough for a good driving experience. In my view, the only features this car must offer more is wider tires and cruise control. Also, Maruti should offer BS 6 diesel engines in new cars and if this happens, I think swift will be an even more fun to drive car.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;5 Jun 2020;Paras Raizada;4.0; Daily Commute;I have clocked 260K KM's in last 10 years with 1.3L Petrol Engine. Just 1 clutch plate change @ 120K KM with tyre change @ every 80K KM's. Only 1 time front and back suspension change and other minor mechanical wear and tear changes. I cannot be happier than this that even after 10 years of life cycle, 260K KM's, its going strong and I believe will be able to clock anywhere around 400K Km's by nex t 2-3 years.I'm addicted to this car and unable to change to new one just because of sheer driving pleasure and ultra low cost maintenance.This car is just amazing......
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;16 Apr 2020;Shriniket Punde;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The first gen swift is considered as one of the most fun to drive hatchbacks in India . My swift , dispite being a diesel, is no exception . It handles great, has a punchy mid range and decent braking too. The things which it misses-out on are most of the creature comforts which are found even in much cheaper car today. My Swift is a 2011 model year and still, the feature list dates back to the 90 's.I still love the car as it has a soul, a happy and energetic nature which is hard to find in cars now-a-days !
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;29 Sep 2019;Kowshick N;4.7; Daily Commute ;The swift is an most conveniante an best handling car for the beginers.. It offers more features like push button start, automatic climate control, touchscreen infotainment system and also provides an fun to drive experience to its owners, the millege is phenomenal in this segment I think bcoz it offers 24km millege in highway. Overall it satisfies the all things for beginners. And safety features also implemented in this car ex...ABS, EBD, airbags such I preety excited about this factors of my swift
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;10 May 2020;Samskrithy;3.3; Family Car ;1. Its a family vehicle. good for city drives. comfy till an extend for a long trips... have traveled a maximum of 9000 km in a strech. 2. the best thing is that it is easy to maintain.. the maintenance cost is low.. everything stays within the budget.3. the negative side is the lag.. seats and the steering wheel.4. mileage is good....pickup for that segment is easy-to-go.....build quality is baad ..... no vibrations till 110-120 kmph.... features are also okay.5. after sale value is high...
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;20 Jan 2021;Venkateshwar..;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Was a particularly good purchase for its time and did enjoy the comfort for the initial 4 years.Predictability of the vehicle safety and reliability took a big hit by around the 8th year of the ownership, When the thermal sensor broke and spilled the coolant into the engine.The sheer absence of good diagnostic toolkit and a not so commendable service by msm even after 9 years of consistent track r ecord with them, Leaves much to be desired from maruthi :(.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;28 Oct 2019;Gourav Rathore;2.0; Occasional Commute | Tours;Not comfortable and not spacious for back seat passengers. I drive only for weekend trips or long trips on highway feel low power or on hills face alot of problem with it compare to my friends Hyundai grand i10 his car performs well and also looks small in size but spacious and have all features like stearing mounted controls and abs all disc brakes and engine performance like pickup and average a lso so good compare to my swift in all way worth it car.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;9 Nov 2020;Deepu Pato;3.3; Family Car ;The overall car design and the rigidity are awesome but the problem arises with the safety where the maruti suzuki has not even given the rear parking sensors.The car is not so spacious and the maintenance cost is also so high as compared to the features and all if you ask me to buy this car or not then i will prefer you not to bu this because the car is not at all safe, And spacious.But if you wa nt a car which have a good mileage and a good design.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;24 May 2020;Anand Purush..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;i am using swift VDI from 2012. I feel the car performance , maintenance and driving is good . I enjoy driving being in driver seat . cons > - i feel only four adults can accommodate in that car.- ingress /egress in the back seat is horrible; elders will never like it .- Air con is bad; it is just adequate for the front row .. during the peak summer you feel it is not at all sufficient .. - driver seat is not fully ergonomics for people above 5.2

MarutiSuzuki;Swift;2 Jul 2020;Partha P;3.3; Daily Commute ;The Swift Vxi is reasonably sturdy, but the mileage is something that definitely should have been more. Mileage within the city is approximately 11 to 12 Kmpl and on long drives, it is approximately 16 Kmpl. Lack of airbags and other safety measures is a definite worry. But overall in terms of performance, it has been quite good. Smooth rides with no engine problem in the last six years.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;1 Sep 2019;Updates Global;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I purchased new hyundai venue before a week and i was wishing to exchange my 2 years old maruti swift with itself. But after 1 week of driving experience of hyundai venue i realise that it doesn't meets the standard of maruti swift.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;6 Jun 2020;Raman Bhardwaj;4.7; Family Car ;I have spent wonderful 4 years with Maruti Suzuki swift ZXI. Driving it was always fascinating. I it was the easiest car to drive. I learnt driving on a old model 3 geared jeep. Then after much consideration I bought swift zxi. Easiest car to drive , no maintenance cost, easy smooth driving. While driving it you get a feel of sports car. Just amazing...
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;1 Sep 2020;Pranav J;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;The car is good for daily use as its economic and the maintenance is less. The suspension is not very good and ride comfort is average. On the highway its comfortable but hitting a pothole is a pain in the ass. I would not recommend for long ride since the build quality is below average . A small pressure even with your hand on the body causes a dent .
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;13 May 2020;Anika Dhanan..;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Everything is good when you name mileage, maintenance cost,features safety is good but body shield is an average not a tough body it feels like.seats are not comfortable for long drive.Petrol engine performance is superb as I am driving Baleno RS which is made for performance.All other factors of this car are well satisfactory.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;11 Oct 2020;Varun 1955;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;It is a budget sports vehicle i have been owning swift sinec 2009 and i have no major complains all these years and i have never waited for a long time for replacing any spares of the car ,every spares are available everywhere ,even during the the corona lockdown tge spares were available . It is an evergreen vehicle
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;11 Aug 2020;Rajat Dhingra;2.7; Daily Commute ;Affordable car at this price. If you are concerned about your safety and your family's safety do not go for this car. Every car has some pros and cons same goes with swift. If you r looking for a affordable car at low maintenance cost and you are not concerned about your saftey then swift can be a very good option.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;3 Dec 2020;Suresh Chandran;3.7; Occasional Commute;By styling wise.. no car can compete with swift in terms of hatchback category..But performance wise not that much good in highways.. Over noise in engine if we reach 110 or more than that.. not worthy for money when compare with previous version swift.. person who seeking for mileage can for swift blindly..
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;20 Dec 2020;Kiran Shahasane;3.7; Family Car ;Car build quality should be improved.The dealer should be given 0ne hours to the customer for car inspection at delivery time.I had taken the car delivery on 19th march 2020 from my car vashi, But the dealer did not give this opportunity for car inspectionthis should not happen with another customer.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;14 Jan 2020;Pik Singh;3.3; Daily Commute ;We got 17.1kmpl in the city, and 22.6kmpl out on the highway. For a sporty hatch, the Swift rides quite well. But wait, it's a diesel automatic, more likely to be ferrying a family around. Well, in that case, it never truly isolates you or the passengers from what's happening under the wheels
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;17 Aug 2020;Himanshu Madan;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car;2014 swift vxi seems to lack a lot in terms of safety , the maintenance is kind of pricey on 10k at every paid service , maybe because it's my first time owning a car , but I like the performance , somewhat adequate if you drive it sanely , but best part for me is the design , just love it .

MarutiSuzuki;Swift;27 Mar 2020;Zeeshan Nazir;3.3; Family Car ;I own Maruti Suzuki Swift ZDI (2015 model), when it comes to mileage the car is highly fuel efficient but could have been better interms of build quality. Also the safety features could have been better.Comfort level is good but is lagging behind other cars in the segment.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;30 Sep 2020;Ashutosh Thakur;4.3; Family Car;I personally likes swift new model , power, looks, comfort everything under a budget .Mileage is a bit issue while driving in city it gives around 11-12 mileage which is quite low and day by day fuel price is rising so it may feel expensive a bit for middle class.
MarutiSuzuki;Swift;9 Sep 2020;Vikram Tanwar;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;My first car and I love it. It never left me midway, Safe, reliable and zero maintainance. I drove it on Hilly roads, highways and streets, just awesome. On highways its mileage touches 26. Great isn't it? I didn't had to pull out 'jack' even once in 5 years.

MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;26 Sep 2020;Kajal Singh;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;This is my first ever Car. I've been driving Delta variant and the experience is amazing. The only obstacle was running over potholes that could be easily felt. The car is light weighted within this range as compared to I-20 which is why it shakes a little when it's running over 80 or 100kpmh. Overall experience is smooth. Features and other alerts are good. Handling is pretty easy, speakers are n ormal. Dent is really common with maruti cars because of its average built quality though it doesn't give you that feel at all. Baleno gives you equal comfort and styling inside out. Dashboard looks cool and adjustable stearing is an add on. Spacious leg room. The design is apt at this price. I myself have opted for Baleno over swift and I20. Price is the major factor that beats I20 the difference is over 1lac with similar offerings.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;4 Nov 2020;Ananth Kumar;3.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car;I bought a ZETA petrol 2019 APRIL, it's been 20 months now still unable to login Suzuki connect, somehow data entry guy's made some mistakes so still I couldn't access full potential of my vehicles ease of convenience which I bought but couldn't use it, it's waste of money, after sales Service was a joke on this issue, rest is ok, can be go on easy, you paid for it but you couldn't use it that's a nnoying yaar, made so many calls & service's still my issue isn't resolved😡, I won't recommend, look for similar other options available not in Suzuki ofcourse.. stay safe drive safe.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;27 Aug 2020;Chinmay Panda;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Love the car as it is, awesome performance, comfortable enough, mileage wise also good. Entertainment system is also good. Sitting capacity is also enough, leg space is also gives you a fantastic feeling, only issue is in the suspension is quite stiff you will feel it while you are on a rough road. Car is very steady even you are on 120 speed. Breaking system could have improved a bit. More over s tyle wise means overall look wise you won't feel out dated, it always looks freash..to summarise it, the car is value for your money , you won't get disappointed if you are planning to buy it.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;30 Oct 2020;Vadish verma;3.7; Daily Commute ;My sister recently bought the maruti baleno delta 'base' variant in august.The car looks very premium inside out, And despite being a base model we have dual airbags, Seat belt reminder, Speed reminder etc.We also get a 12 v charging socket, Leather upholstery, An aftermarket pioneer touchscreen infotainment system, Etc too.There are ample amount of bottle holding spaces in every door, Decent amou nt of boot space and nice space at the rear seat.What not really good in this car is it's safety, Which remains standing at 2 stars.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;30 May 2020;Denny Devassy;5.0; Family Car;It's a beautiful car and stands to the classification of being a premium hatch back.. True ambient feel inside the cabin.. Best for a family of upto 5 as all 5 can fit without any space shortage.. Love every bit of my car.. Service delivery team is supportive and manage the customer relations well (showroom from where I bought my car, so this is personal comment). Words won't be enough so let me w rap up saying the best premium hatch back I have driven so far..
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;5 Dec 2019;Dharitri Devi;4.0; Family Car;Really a fuel efficient car i am getting a mileage of 15 in the city and almost 20 i the highways. Looks great its initial pickup is also better than i20. I have driven upto the speed of 150kmph. But it has some cons also...it doest feel stable after crossing 120. And the most important is its built quality which is very poor. Otherwise the car is awesome very spacious very reliable you must go fo r it
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;10 Dec 2020;Dipesh Prasad;2.7; Daily Commute ;Purchased baleno from kts nexa mumbai.Faulty vehicle delivered, Within first 2 months clutch and steering was replaced.Overall vehicle is quite spacious, Necessary features are available but interior plastic quality can be improved.Interior plastic doesn't feel premium at all.Don't purchase vehicle from kts nexa.They deliver faulty vehicles.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;8 Jun 2020;Pritpal Singh;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours;I bought this car in and I'm happy with mileage performance but some time I feel I should not drive above 90 as this car doesn't giveme that confidence it feels light and brakes are light too. For city driveing it's good and low maintenance looks bold and it is spacious than other rivals in Premium hatchback.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;15 Dec 2020;Indranil Bha..;5.0; Family Car ;Best buy in range of 6 to 8 lakh, Good comfort, Big boot space, Huge leg room, Best economy in class, Better power delivery with respect to other hatchbacks, Well balanced car loved all hides in planes as well as hills.You can do moderate off roading also.Very low maintenance as a whole good car to have it.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;5 Sep 2020;Ricky Khatri;4.7; Daily Commute ;I have a baleno diesel but these guys don't have an option select diesel engine in baleno. Its running cost and maintainence cost is pretty low, feels like driving an activa. Just the headlamps are pretty expensive, as I have the alpha variant. So be careful for them if you're running the top spec model
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;30 Aug 2020;Santosh Meena;4.3; Daily Commute ;I have been using this car Since the car launched i.e Nov 2015, No maintenance cost, because loaded with all features, Nice Car with many Premium loaded features, build quality lower side, back seat also having lot of ample space, Boot Space pretty amazing, Average of 20-22 on highway and 15-18 in City
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;25 Feb 2020;Praan Agarwal;3.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Very great space everywhere you need in a executive hatchback .But rear seat has low thig support means very discomfort on long rides.Mileage is really decent. Safety features really mising .A lot of news is there related to accidents with Baleno - baleno - baleno . I feel i will change vehicle soon .
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;13 Aug 2020;Aman Agarwal;4.3; Tours ;The car is comfortable overall fun to drive but it only provide you with little power 88ps and upto100ps in rs model which is not enough when you are driving with 4 co passenger it's pick up is not good at all but overall if you are driving with 2 person or 3 it's really fun and responsive.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;6 Sep 2019;Jayanta Hand..;3.7; Family Car ;I have been driving baleno Zeta model petrol facelift from last 15 days, Everything is okay but the suspension and fuel consumption are not as I expected. I have swift dzire vxi petrol 2nd 2017 last old model, I think that one is very good for fuel consumption.. Always average 17 and above.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;26 Jun 2020;Ezra Matthew;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Generally good for local riding where no major collision or anything could be possible. If the whole body is weighty and strong enough to safeguard the travelling people, even though mileage should be less by 5 to 7 km per litre, Baleno would be the ruling master with riding confidence.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;14 Apr 2020;NAVEEN P;4.3; Family Car;it is vary stylish car and mileage is good compare to other cars in maruthi, when we dive in city ground clearance is the main problem in this car especially speed breakers touches the car and also back seat boot space is good suspension is some what problem for back seat passangers
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;3 Sep 2020;Nahush Kunte;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am using Baleno Zeta diesel since May 2017 and I have driven so far 56000 kms and I am really happy with the performance of the car. It has nice power and mileage and car is very stable on highways with speed of 120-130. I get around 24KMPL on highways and 20KMPL in city traffic.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;23 Aug 2020;Syril Sinken;5.0; Family Car ;Fantastic and marvelous ride ,much leg space, overall good shape and best in segments and also in interior and exterior of the car .The car 220km/per as its maximum speed .It has smart sensing ac and revere control.the radio has entirely different system from other cars in I India
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;26 Aug 2020;Ravi Teja;4.7; Family Car ;The looks of the car is excellent and spacious for 5 people, I have never faced any issue with Performance and braking, the best car one can own. The only thing to improve is build quality and the plastic quality apart from this its really excellent car, Happy Motoring to All
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;16 Nov 2019;Kumar Siva;5.0; Family Car ;Many said it was not a safe car for it's weight. But by all my experience it is more stable and it's breaking is more accurate when I compare it with my previous cars VW Polo and Swift. Baleno is also much better in comfort as compared to any relevant alternatives.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;11 Oct 2020;Aditya Chhetri;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;The bodywork feels okay at best, performance is satisfactory. The style is something which grows on you eventually, even though the back is just ugly. A lot of hard plastics, a sleek center console and great back seat space. 9/10 would recommend as a family car.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;6 Oct 2020;Thamizh Nesan;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;A superb car in this section. I really enjoy riding it. A/C is very cool and prompt to respond. Highway riding is extraordinary. I get a mileage of 24+. it's really impeccable for a Zeta Petrol variant. I've been using this car for more than two years.

MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;27 Sep 2019;Hariharapras..;3.0; Family Car ;As a first time owner of a car, I feel, features are less, seat comfort less, internal lighting very poor, external lighting below normal, ADD ONs poor, transmission good, body strength poor, should have been technically more advanced.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;19 Dec 2019;Airwa Ayush;5.0; Family Car;I was going for Dzire but when I saw the BALENO then I compared its features with Dzire then I saw that there are so many features in BALENO then Dzire. It is so stylish hatchback with a lot of features. This is the SUPER CAR .
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;28 Jun 2019;Lucky Rk;2.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Baleno is the best for adult. Very smoothly drive and normal mileage. Maruti suzuki servicing center for Manipur, Imphal - 795001 is very lazy and dull compare to the other car company servicing center. I hate Manipur,Imphal MARUTI SUZUKI servicing center next time when something happened to my car I will never go to MARUTI SUZUKI servicing center I will go to normal car workshop.

MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;13 Oct 2020;Renjan Rajeev;4.3; Family Car ;Since I own a Baleno for 2 years, I would say it is the best choice for family users looking for practicality and economy but whereas if it was for Driver Enthusiast it is better to skip Maruti Suzuki in the segment.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;5 Aug 2020;Aman Deep;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Yes I aggree with its features and comfortable and am happy to be purchase, interior is better than other cars and space also, cooling system too good, great power steering power windows and music system awesome

MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;11 Sep 2020;Rivu Chakrab..;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Great car in this budget. A bit unstable at high speed, ~120 due to light weight. Also, build quality is a bit off. Apart from that everything is great, especially performance and mileage.

MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;13 Feb 2019;Ajitkumar Tr..;4.7; Daily Commute;GOOD MILLEGE BUT WEAK BULIT BODY
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;5 Apr 2020;Sankarkrishn..;2.0; Family Car;I was waiting for months to buy the petrol version. But now I am disappointed. There is nothing new in the updated brezza. Still missing below features.1) Tyre pressure monitor system2) Hill start assist ( only in AT)3) Electronic stability control ( only in AT)4) Rear A/c vents.5) Sunroof.Manual variant has nothing. In addition to this Maruti is not giving their Smart Hybrid system to manual vers ion. That means no idle start stop system. Now why this car?? Sad to say this but Maruti didn't utilised the opportunity to improve. Vitara brezza lost its Unique value.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;11 Oct 2020;Venu N;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;My car crossed 3000 mark already. Its pick up is satisfactory though not the best. For daily commuters like me who drive car maximum 130 kmph , it s ok. I am getting 15 to 15.5 kmpl on highways , 13.5 on local roads . In off-road trips i got as less as 11.3 kmpl. Spec and price is very good for a car like this. After sales service is excellent. the service station guys respond to our quiries even at 8 pm !
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;25 Feb 2020;Sreenivasa Rao;2.3; Daily Commute ;Kitna dethi hai people, this is correct vehicle. Comfort nil. Serious blind spots on sides due to improper placing of ORVMs. Front seats horrible. Need additional ortho seat attachments. Poor quality painting. Safety I am not sure, will it sustain any crash. Maintenance cost is average. But poor handling by Maruti service centres. Service executives dos not know how to behave with the customers.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;29 Mar 2020;Jabir Kasim;2.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car;Compare to other cars like venue, creta and seltos. Less features and styling. Especially interior quality and style very bad. Interior style very old like 2012maruthi swift. Eg. Stearing... No rear ac. No head rest in rear seat in base model. In my opinion they should consider this as basic things of car when customs they spend more than 8lakh.now in market a lot other options available.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;1 Sep 2020;Cashew2902;4.0; Daily Commute ;Its a good overall package. Good drive experience. Decent mileage in petrol as well, so pretty fuel efficient i must say. Drive performance is better than Nexon and Ecosport since this is a 4 cylinder engine and the others have a 3 cylinder engine. Thats why bought it.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;9 Aug 2020;Karthik Sinha;2.0; Daily Commute ;Recently switched from swift zdi to brezza zxi+, downside is: it lack power and in elevated terrain you will feel the lag; the interior plastic is very cheap and fragile, you can easily feel it on the dashboard and the indicator switches.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;19 Jul 2020;Duyu Tagio;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Performance wise it's good, mileage best, just need to improve it's comfort. Stiff suspension and body noise.

MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;2 Sep 2020;Vaishali Kapoor;4.3; Daily Commute;Overall look of the car is amazing...very comfortable as a compact SUV. Mileage is quite impressive but as compared to other maruti products it could have been better. Good purchase at this price.

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;29 Mar 2020;Rajendra Giri;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;excellent family sedan. This car is without ABS but this car never Crossed City boundaries so far and most likely will never. Thus as Good as without ABS. But even in VXi they did not provide rear glass defogger. That is enough essential feature in rainy season. Moreover VXi is a mid rang Sedan car and shauffer driven people at least deserve a reading light above them. My Ford Fusion 1.6 Duratec 2 006 model has two reading light for rear passengers.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;4 Nov 2020;HItesh Mittal;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Car feels good based on the configuration.Perform best on the highways as well as intercity.Safety features are embodied and in tune to the requirement.Body strength: at par and compared to tata, Very poor.Service experience: people remember maruti from the age of 2001 till 2014.It was very upward and visibly less expensive.With the stroke of 2015, Things are unprofessional, Expensive and below av erage experience.Still better than tata.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;2 Dec 2020;Mohit Kumar;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;car is good but most of maruti service centers are bad.i mean there you will get total negligence and workmanship is below average..i got my accidental repais from anand motors lucknow and it was pathetic..utterly disappointed by their services and if i got it repaired outside it would have cost me less and the work would be much better than theirsso think before you buy as their cars are good but services are not
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;4 May 2020;FOR YOUR;3.7; Family Car ;Worst accident repair in Haldwani maruti suzuki agency worst work 0 % of care will be taken of your car there ,expect and do your car maintenance always from outside ,they damaged my car's fender when it was kept in company under accident maintenance they hitted my car's fender over there and didn't replaced it and even they didn't repaired it
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;21 Dec 2020;SreeHari Kar..;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;For hassle free driving and comfortable city driving, The maruti suzuki swift dzire vxi at is certainly among the best.Good mileage, Comfortable driving, Good pull (have gone on trips with 6 people in the car, And there hasn't been any lag that was felt), This car is a good bet.However, The major drawback is the lack of airbags.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;1 Dec 2020;Vipul Goel;3.7; Daily Commute ;superb engine, great torque. Have done 175kmph on Expressway. Suspension is hard. Seats are very comfortable with great thigh support. City mileage with AC is about 15, without AC is 19. Engine is somewhat noisy. Window glass is very thin, leading to outside noise creeping in.

MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;19 Sep 2020;Tadvi Narendra;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I am using Ertiga VXI BS6 model from last one year. Overall good ,pick up is good. Car is running in City area ,so, mileage is around 12.5 to 13 kms. Ertiga is very good option for low cost MPV, space is also good. But body is very light, needs improvement in roof structure. Disappointing thing is that door glass cleaning wiper also not coming with VXI model. Feels difficult in rainy season. I kno w we can fit it from market,but this is also necessary.
MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;14 Dec 2019;Sunil Kumar;2.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Poor NVH, Lot of wind noise and engine noise creeps in at speed above 7 kmph.Worst mileage, only 16 on highways driven at less than 80 kmph and only driver seated.

MarutiSuzuki;Alto800;22 Oct 2020;Vadish verma;3.0; Family Car ;I bought the maruti alto 800 in february 2012.The color is granite grey, And the car looks pretty nice when properly cleaned.Under the good is a 0.8l petrol engine which churns out 40.3bhp and 60 nm of torque.The power figures might be very astonishingly low, But the performance of the car is average.The quality levels of the car is also decent.Inside the door gets fabric claddings and nice grey l eather upholstery.There are very much hard plastics, But they still are of a decent quality.The variant is lxi, The mid variant, And things which i get are 12 inch steel wheels with silver wheel caps, Yes that's a very small size.Has a standard normal digital instrument system, Analog speedometer with a digital display that shows time, Fuel to empty, And distance.Front seats are quite comfortable, No adjustable headrests of course, And under thigh support is quite decent enough.At the rear however, Three people cannot sit comfortably as there is a very huge h**p in the center, And the seats are very low, With very small, In fact tiny headrests which provide no whiplash support in case of a crash.The boot space is also quite decent, 177 litres, Which can be increased by lowering both the rear seats down.Talking about the safety, There is nothing.No abs, No ebd, No reverse parking cameras, No seat belt pretensioners, Nothing.Even the build quality is very poor, The c pillars easily dent inside if you press them with a thumb.
MarutiSuzuki;Alto800;21 Sep 2020;SUMAN BABU;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;best for a small familyand a average performance car The major change though is in the inside of the car. The dashboard is completely new and you now get coloured seat fabric which works well with the overall ambience of the car. The top-end LXi variant gets a CD/MP3 player, air-conditioning, power steering and front power windows. What it does not get is central locking, and a left rear-view mirr or.The Alto 800 still comes powered by the 796cc, three-cylinder which has been refined. There's also a faster 32-bit processor and this engine is future-proof for BS5 norms too. The engine responds to your throttle input and the gearshifts are typically Maruti Suzuki, well slotted.Maruti has priced the top-end Alto 800 at Rs 2.99 lakhs and this is truly something significant. They have been able to price it so competitively that the customers have to give it a second thought before going in for a car belonging to a rival company.
MarutiSuzuki;Alto800;7 Dec 2019;VISHNU KUMAR;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;This is my first car, For the Past 3years it drives smooth performance and it’s the lowest maintenance cost, and some are saying that this is not good for long drive, No they are actually wrong it’s the most best car for long drive without any problem . So in this 800 segment alto is best car apart from kwid and redigo. See you can have better interior n exterior in kwid n redigo but the engin e performance wise alto is my best choice to the entry level people, even wise in alto 800 exterior n interior you can customised easily as per your preference and it looks better n stylish car from kwid n redigo.🔥💯

MarutiSuzuki;Alto800;3 Jul 2019;Naresh Kumar;1.0; Daily Commute ;I suggest to every customer, do not buy maruti cars and although you buy then do not spend extra money on extended warranty. The maruti customer care or the dealer will not help you whether you have extended warranty. They deny to replace your vehicle part at all. This is my recent personal experience of vipul motors faridabad and maruti itself. Don't buy maruti car at all Go for other brand for s atisfaction and quality.After all you are going to spend one time amount for at least 5 year. so go for better than Maruti.

MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;30 Apr 2020;Vansh Gautam;5.0; Family Car ;Our Datsun Go completed its 4.5 years in January 2019,and we were quite bored with the old car.We were looking for a compact automatic car which could also be used by the ladies in the house.We zeroed in on the smallest automatic available in the Indian market...Alto K 10 AMT. The Maruti guys were called home and we did the booking for Alto K10 AMT.The research was still going on weighing the pros and cons.It was always on the back of my mind that there will be no premium feature even in the top trim.We still had some time so I searched for the next small thing which was Celerio.Now the features which distinguish it from tiny Alto are R 14 tyres, Anti lock braking system (ABS) ,Rear Wiper , all four power windows and bigger cabin which means comfortable seating and storage spaces.All this came at a price of just 1.5 lacs over the earlier choice so we immediately called the dealer and asked him if we could change our selection, and he was more than happy and called this as a fine decision making by us.Now on the delivery day I bargained for the leather steering cover and the leather seat covers which took little extra time in the handover but it was worth.The cabin is quieter, air conditioning is comfortable even in very high ambient temperature conditions.Music system is awesome with bluetooth connectivity , 4 speakers and steering mounted audio controls.Gear shifts in amt mode are smooth.Torque and power are good enough for the size of the car.Ground clearance and suspension is good to take any terrain.ABS allows very good short distance braking.Front , rear window wipers and defogger provides an efficient system to tackle heavy weather be it rain,dust or cold.Talking about more premium features it has automatic speed sensing door locks, seat belt warning for driver and front passenger, high speed warnings, door ajar warning, automatic cabin light, creep function which is disabled if there is an ajar door.For safety there are 2 airbags in front as opposed to only 1 in the The Alto K10 top trim.It's been a little over 1 year and I am still amazed with the choice I made.Overall it is a thrilling yet economical option.Don't think twice just go for it.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;26 Aug 2020;Shrikant She..;4.7; Daily Commute ;Purchased for city commute and occasional highway drive because it had better looks than Wagon-r. On petrol the mileage in city is around 18-20 and on highway 21-23(again depends on driving style). But in CNG the mileage in city is 22-25 and on highway its around 26-30(speed must be in between 80-100). Interior is average, not very basic not too fancy. Gets 2 airbags but lacks high speed stability due to less kurb weight. Engine performs really well, there is lag in the bottom end but really picks up pace after 3000rpm. I drove it at around 150kmph on petrol and 130kmph on CNG. Reliability of engine is good, doesnt burn much oil even if the car is on CNG mode for months(good practice is to drive it on pertol for 15-20km once a week). Speaking of built quality, its the same as expected from a maruti car. It rattles and squeaks on bad roads but is silent on good roads. Braking is not good nor bad but decent and ABS works well(only engages on places it should). Comfort too is decent for front as well as rear passengers compared to Wagon-r as the rear seats in celerio are not upright(not in kind of bench format). One can easily cover 350+kms without a break. Gearbox too is slick shifting and perfectly matches with the rev happy k10B engine(just judders a bit in reverse gear). Talking about sales and services the my celerio VXI(optional) varient costed me 5.71lakh (18thousand extra for passenger side airbag and ABS which is now mandatory in every car). Sales are good as parts and service stations are available in almost every city of India. The first major paid service costed me 5,516rs after 13000km(which is not bad as oil, oil filter, cabin air filter, intake filter, throttle body cleaning, replacing all spark plugs, wheel alignment and balancing, etc was done). According to me its better alternative than Wangon-r in all aspects. Thank you
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;23 Mar 2020;Karanveer Singh;1.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;IT WILL NOT GIVE YOU MILEAGE BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT DUE TO MILEAGE AND ALSO TRY TO BUY MANUAL OVER AMT.I AM GETTING MILEAGE OF 14,15 IN CITY AND 18,19 ON HIGHWAY.YOU'LL HAVE TO BE REALLY LIGHT ON FOOT TO GET MILEAGE.Try to go for more powerful car LIKE SWIFT PETROL OR WAGONR 1.2 PETROL(BODY IS THERE).If you're looking for a car in which you get instant acceleration.Good performance than it not for yo u.Once at speed of 30 my car hit ford Figo (nothing happened to it) but my front bumper came out with several cracks and fender bend.Once again a dog instantly came in infront of my car at speed of 60 kmh and then it hit him a little and my grill +crack on bumper +fog lamp position and bumper was lowered by that.Not satisfied with this car at all.After this I am buying another but not Maruti at all very bad build quality.Service experience is all really bad and they don't listen to you.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;2 Oct 2020;Prakash R;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;About Celerio X zxi: 1. Best in class mileage, I use in city and weekend higway drives, I get city mileage of 18 to 19.2kmpl and in highway average 20.5 to 21.4 (speed below 90kmph)2. Cost: Service cost after all the free services, they charge 4k (including1500/- for engine oil too)3. Comfortable: Comfortable for 4 heavy people. and the drive is butter smooth.4. Power: Drive is butter smooth, but it lacks power for immediate pickup.5. Speed: As I tested its top speed till 165kmph, but feeling uncontrolled and scary after 145kmph, untill then it looks planted.Overall, best city and long drive car for 5 people. But power does not come immediately, it takes time when car is fully loaded.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;17 Feb 2020;Dr Hemant;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Excellent car, ride quality, handling & response of engine is awesome. cabin is airy & spacious.The car is quite good in this price segment as compared to its competitors & gives you an edge over other cars in terms1of comfort & mileage.I own a celerio & I have driven it more than 110000 kms without any glitch.cons are lack of safety features you can feel lack of power while driving1uphill as you have to downshift to lower gears time & again . overall a very good car
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;5 Jan 2020;Cool Rider25;3.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;The celerio is such an awesome commuting car, i also use it for touring from home city to working city on weekends, performance is also good, for being such an economic car, my one and only hope is that maruthi will raise their bar on safety , because each and everyday people die due to unsafe cars, cars being poor quality in terms of safety. really they have to consider people as their family and build cars, otherwise i am happy about the driving experience
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;15 Nov 2019;Farrukh Merc..;2.3; Daily Commute ;Suspension is not so Good. A/c cooling coil failed one day after warranty expired and company did not approve. Clutch Judder continues even after Clutch replacement. Hord Pad cracked Company says its normal. Pickup is very poor. Good car for city as I have taken AMT Zx version average in petol is14/15 kmpl with a/c in City.MRF tyres have good life just crossed 80,000 kms in 4 years. RSA service is poor. Exide reaches before Maruti Road side Assistance.

MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;24 Aug 2020;Narendran K;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Its a value for money car, at 5.5 L on road, you will get a decent car with basic features like air bag, good space, phone controls on the steering wheel, head room(as it is a tall boy). Performance wise, its ok to have a 1000cc which is sufficient for a city traffic. at the same time it is manageable in travels upto 400kms at a stretch.long story in short - normal indian family budget car
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;23 Mar 2019;Gautam Gupte;3.3; Daily Commute ;Bought AMT for city driving comfort and also for once a month long drive. Not happy with Celerio's AMT - It gives lot of knocking compared to any AT car (maybe that's a problem with all AMTs). Also the shock absorbers of Celerio is not good to give you a comfortable drive, so it gives lot of jerks at back seat. The auto gear shift too takes lot of trouble when you really raise the car in case you are in a hurry and want to rush. e.g. if you raise it from 1st gear, it would go to 2nd gear probably when you cross 40 km/hr. So basically its not smart. But it a good vehicle for city driving.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;18 Dec 2019;Praveen Pras..;3.3; Family Car ;This car is only people with limited budget car is very smooth easy to ride Good pick up Gives me mileage of 15KMPL city ride .Cons are : very poor build quality light weight can't feel safe on highway only top variant has all safety feature overall good car if safety can be overlooked with whatever STD safety feature

MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;15 Jan 2019;Valentine Th..;3.3; Daily Commute ;Celerio is good for milage and city drive. Even on highway its performance is good gives more milage than on record. Its build up and color are very weak. Lot of cabin noise. Boot space is sufficient, plastic used in the car is cheap. Slightly costly vxi model looking to features and safety points. Driving is smooth and pock up better than the new Santr. You don"t feel you are driving 1l car.

MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;20 Jan 2020;Sanjeev Chak..;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car;I bought S Presso Vxi (O) on 16.01.2020 from Prem sona Motors, Karke Road, Ranchi. To my astonishment I discovered later on that when you imply back gear, the lights provided in the tail light only has a provision of bulb on the left back side, while there is no provision of bulb on the right back side. When enquired about the same, the representative told me that the vehicle has provision of only one bulb on left back ride when you back your car. The logic is not explained.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;24 Dec 2020;Ray Michell;1.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;I own an spresso top model, It's an empty box.Windows are too high, Air don't enter.Frontal windows are remotely controlled, Back 2 windows are old fashioned.No rear glass wiper.Very tiny back side glass.Seats are not comfy.No mud guard in rear wheels.While driving and resting hand on window gives the feeling of driving a tempo because window is higher than any other cars.Ceiling is very light.Inc omplete maruti enfotainment service unlike swift top model.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;19 Jan 2020;Selva Ganesh;4.7; Occasional Commute;I bought s presso vxi plus last month....at that time I don't know to drive any car.

MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;10 Jul 2020;Manish Kumar;3.3; Daily Commute ;Due to shorter width of vehicle, turning in speed is too much dangerous. Another thing is that too much noise inside the cabin, no power window in rear & alloy wheels even in top end variants. One more thing is no Fog light is available in top end variants which creates a problem during winter season, not even they give space to fit it from outsides.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;14 Apr 2020;NAVEEN P;2.3; Occasional Commute;looking like suv but outer look is not that much good and back seating also some what difficult especially in long drives it is good in city traffic perfectly suit for tall persons mileage also gives around 16-17 per liter but price is high,on this criteria people are not ready to buy

MarutiSuzuki;SCross;2 Dec 2020;Ayush Modi;5.0; Daily Commute;I doesn't not look like a maruti, the feel of the car is very premium and the mileage is of Maruti.

MarutiSuzuki;XL6;29 Apr 2020;Ishaan Bahal;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;Bought it 3 months ago, have driven over 4k kms, though bought it as a car for office commute and family. First car of mine, wanted to buy something like baleno or Glanza or even altroz. But sat in this car at the showroom, and loved it, then tried venue, Nexon and a few others like wrv, but none provided the comfort this one did, especially on the second row. It's like a different class altogethe r. Did do a lot of research on the cars, even Ertiga. This car shares a lot of things with Ertiga, hell it's basically Ertiga with some enhancements added. But the look makes it more SUV types and not an MUV. Ended up buying this one, base variant, as suggested by the sales rep also, the misses from alpha are not too many and most can be fitted by maruti as extra accessories. I got them all in 10K including nexa lit badging on the doors, leather covers for seats, and rear parking camera. Driving experience has been great, it's a silent car and I love that over Chunky sounding SUVs, it drives like a car meant for city driving and also works quite nice on a highway. Hardly feel bumps etc. Did have an issue with the USB port for android auto from the get go, so got that sorted from maruti for free as a part replacement. More than the car, I actually like Nexa and it's post sale service. For sure the sales wasn't much to write home about, I had to ask someone explicitly to show me the car, but the post sales is actually good. They remind you of everything, even things like how to maintain your car if you forget. The service experience was also pretty great. It could just be my dealer Pasco, but if it's the same experience throughout, then maruti has made a long term customer. Mileage is around 14-15 in city, that's Gurgaon for me, with 12-14 kms daily drive. On highway it goes upto 16-17 too, but you've to drive very efficiently. Also love the fact that basics like temperature controlled cabin etc are available on base variants by default. Word of advice, if you are doubting the car, go and sit in it. Especially the back seat. That'll be the make or break moment for you.
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;5 Sep 2020;Sylesh Gopan;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;We started looking for a new car maybe towards Dec'19. I was always keen on having a compact /normal SUV. Options before us were Creta/ Harrier/ Seltos/ Brezza/ EcoSports. Obviously cost was a factor and thats why you see the range of options :). We started test driving some of these and thats when someone put the idea of XL6 into my mind. To be very frank I was not at all keen not sure why. But w e visited the showroom and saw the car and my daughter just stamped her choice. She was excited to see the 3rd row and was happy that we could take our dog along for trips without much space issues. After checking out XL6 the other options looked less appealing for the family mainly from the space perspective. We booked the Alpha automatic it in Mar but had to wait for delivery till Jul due the lockdown in between. Due to travel restrictions in Pune there wasnt much chance to drive it around even after delivery. Our 1st drive in essence was to Kerala, to our hometown. All in all below is what I liked and not liked about the car so far;Like - Space. Even the 3rd row is accessible and kids can have a gala of time there. - Feels premium - Got mileage of 15-16 km / l - 2nd row seat comfort - Ride comfort - Almost an innova with a huge price diff and premium feeling cabinet - Cabinet is insulated well, outside noise is well filtered - boot space is good even with 3rd row occupiedNot liked - Wheel size. Should have been 16' min - AT gearbox is good, but you may have to get used to it for overtaking mainly on a road without median. - Speakers where not that good for a vehicle at this range. There are less costly vehicle provided with co. fitted bose systems. I changed them with infinity speakers. Oem fitted speakers looked very low quality when i saw while changing.Overall real thumps up !!!
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;19 Oct 2020;Sriram Kasbe;4.3; Family Car ;Good car overall, Has its downsides with too soft dampers in the rear and on highway at 100-120 speeds any bridges will feel like the people in rear are in a rollercoaster.Looks wise better than ertiga any day, Also the cheapest premium car which looks sporty and premium and muv.Its a good combo, Especially the black mirros, Body panelling and the front quadra led lamps, More than enough bright li ght at night, you have to get used to it as it feels lacky than the orange halogens but the color difference is main as we are adjusted to the orange light and we feel a bit discomfort in white led.Other than that this car is paisa wasool.The economy depends on your riding and unlike other cars where even if you accelerate slow you get 15kmpl here you will easily get 22kmpl if you accelerate gently and keep gears changing, you can go 40kmph in 5th gear and with very less stress to the engine, It is a very usable car.
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;17 Nov 2019;Sandeep Gupta;4.7; Family Car;I took delivery of my XL6 in late August, and till date I have covered 2000+ kms in 3 months with mileage of >16 kmpl. I have upsized the tyres to Bridgestone Turanza 195/65 on the same R15 alloys, which has added well to the already smooth ride with even less road noise. Overall, except the lack of airbag protection for the middle row (and it's this row in XL6 which is being differentiated agains t Ertiga), I am very happy with XL6. This is a 100% family car, so do not expect much driving thrills. My other car is SX4, 2011 make, which is still much more fun to drive with it's 1.6L engine and R16 alloys, but with very poor mileage (any SX4 giving mileage >10 kmpl is fantastic).
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;25 Jun 2020;Anup Singh;4.7; Family Car;well!! I brought this car in diwali n today whenever I drive this car it feels like I driving new car the comfertableness is just mind blowing u will never feel tired in this car wheather u go for long drive...I have few problem that the wheels should more bigger n also the engine area should be cover with plastic of any material because whenever I take this car for wash I always get scared the wa ter should not get on battery of wireings..
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;15 Nov 2020;Vision X;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;it is basically a affordable version of innova also a muscled version of eartiga it is super comfy in all the three rows except for 3rd one for those who are more than 5'10''. yes that 103 Bhp may sound less but it is second highest in the competition and tires could have been bigger like 16 or maybe 17 inch. At the end of the day it offers a decent package that one will take back home everyday wi th a smile.
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;2 Dec 2020;Nikhil Pathak;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Nice car for family, comfortable good space mileage also good for a big car....

MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;16 Feb 2020;Vijay Kumar;4.0; Family Car;Owning/Driving Ignis Zeta MT from last 14 months, crossed 9500 kms on odometer till now. My buying experience:As I had already owned secondhand Maruti 800cc and driven Alto K10 (1000 cc) cars in the past & now wish to buy a new car for the first time, I was looking for a 1200cc car, within budget of 6.5 lakhs, so shortlisted Swift, New Hyundai Santro, Tata Tiago and Ignis. Took test drive of each of them. Facelift Swift VXI was overall a good car but costing at around 7.06 lakhs OTR, Santro Asta test drive was not satisfactory. Tata Tiago XZ was at 6.30 lakhs OTR but had 3 cylinder engine.Further I found that Maruti Swift, Baleno, Dezire & Ignis have the same K12B petrol engine generating similar power.Due to heavy year-end discounts the Ignis Zeta MT was costing me at 6.39 lakhs OTR. In this price I was getting a 1200cc 4 cylinder engine car with 15 inch Alloy Wheels, Push Button Start, Body Cladding, Blue tooth & steering control enabled music system having 6 speakers, Fog lamps, Rear-defoggers with wash wipers, Auto folding ORVM, Extended warranty, NEXA Card & Fast tag. Unbeatable deal, So ignored all other options and finalised the Ignis.From test drive to delivery of the car, NEXA dealership have given me a very nice and memorable experience.Pros:Peppy driving.Standard safety features across all variants.Very good mileage, 14-15 in city & 20-22 on highways with AC on.High ground clearance.Sufficient head and leg room.Easy ingress and outgress.Low maintenance & service cost.Many small features in Ignis such as Door handle design, adjustable head rests on all seats, 60:40 foldable rear seat, Split tail light, bigger tyres, etc are found only in costlier and premium cars.Cons:Rear design of the car is very unique but not appealing to the masses and it is the sole reason behind low sales figures of the Ignis.Body panels are weaker compared to other cars as it easily get dents from hitting of small stones on the road.Somewhat stiff suspension.Servicing at regular Maruti Dealership, so no NEXA experience after purchase.My experience with the car:My routine driving is on poor roads. I have also taken a long road trip with family in my Ignis. But no problem at all.First 3 services within a year are free from Maruti. It costs me around 3600rs. for the oil change, wheel balancing alignment and minor spares till today.From my own experience I can say that Ignis is the Best car at this price point. I recommend to buy NEXA card, as the whole cost of the card can be redeemed within a year.Extended warranty is a gimmick and may be avoided.
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;18 Jan 2021;Gift Ajay;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;We selected this car as a family on 2017. I went by engine specifications, power output, ground clearance and drive dynamics. The wife and kid chose the color, a car small on the outside but large on the inside; while the father a previous Maruti Wagonr owner selected the model and the accessories. All this narrowed down to a bundle called the Ignis. Happy and feeling blessed with the Ignis.
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;12 Dec 2020;Persi Mistry;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car;It is smooth car ride but only sometimes v get jerk while realizing brake pedal on stop signal n pressing acellator. That time little jerk v observe but on the hold car is good for driving long distance going to up-country. Or shift in manual mode it climbs in 1st or 2nd gear for mountainous roads like Khandala, Lonavla, Mahad Ghats Road, Mahableshwar or Panchgani etc..

MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;21 Sep 2020;Karan Sharma;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Iy has been 3 years since i got Ignis Alpha Top Model Manual. It is a good city car with best in class gear box and clutch. But if you are looking for a vehicle which is comfortable for long road trips than this one is not for you. In Bumby roads you can feel everything inside the cabin. And at the end of you travel tou will feel exhausted
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;1 Aug 2020;Tinu George;4.7; Family Car ;I had driven my maruti ignis about 10,000 km still it is giving me a wonderful feel of driving . And I'm also happy with the mileage .

MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;4 Mar 2019;Manu Jose;4.0; Family Car ;Ignis is a compact car, but it is very much spacious in its segment. I would say its the perfect car for beginners. Easy to drive. I own a manual transmission petrol engine. Power delivery is smooth, engine doesn"t lags. Fun to drive , post 2500 rpm its flying. Sound damping is not so great. We can feel that when the car is moving through rough surface roads. But overall its great. Again one word perfect for beginners

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;1 Jan 2021;Praveen Muth..;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Ciaz is not for car enthusiasts.It's a very comfortable car with a lot of legroom and 3 adults can sit comfortably in the rear seat as there isn't a big h**p in the middle.The cabin is very spacious and the beige treatment in the interior gives a good airy feel.The engine is very refined and has good amount of initial torque.But at the final range there isn't enough power output.The engine loves t o rev a lot.I personally feel that msil could have given it a 6th gear.The clutch is super-duper light and shifting is so easy.It is an easy car to drive in the city as well as on highways.The steering is very light that it doesn't give any feel or feedback.The suspension is on the softer side and absorbs most of the bumps and potholes very well.There are few issues with the car, That is, There are panel gaps everywhere.Actually the panel gaps are big and the fit and finish isn't great.The quality levels could have been improved both in the interior as well as exterior.Overall the car suits your parents very well but it doesn't inspire the youngsters because ciaz is much of a comfort oriented car and not a sporty one.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;19 Sep 2020;Gokul Gopakumar;4.3; Family Car ;As this is comfort oriented Sedan, all of its components incl. engine is tuned in such a way. Therefore don't expect any sort of performance. If you floor the throttle the sound of the engine becomes so loud that some wouldn't be liking it. But personally I like its sound when I floor it. Suspension in tuned in such a way that it offers maximum comfort at the cost of handling. Some defects in the vehicle that I found was poor quality of plastics used and the sound from the speakers are below average that you couldn't increase the volume because the rattling all around the cabin is obnoxious
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;18 Jul 2020;Ayush Agrawal;3.3; Family Car ;This car is a cool sedan you will get a feel of seating in a lap of luxury just like any other premium brand. The sole reason I am disappointed is its super soft suspension that gets pressed if we have rear passengers affecting the ground clearance, this vehicle I own is being tested @140kmph and have found it severing while at that top notch that means Suzuki has lacked some aerodynamics too. The worst part which now is being cured in the updated model is its headlight in my model it's ridiculous. By the way I own a ZXI+
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;16 Apr 2019;Venkatasubra..;2.0; Daily Commute ;First of all petrol mileage is nowhere near what was promised!! Despite talk claims of smart hybrid. Looks cosmetic with no real value addition. Infotainment is a disaster on 2 accounts 1) They sold a chip for 10k which is supposed to be a GPS along with car. It is totally useless. We can enter only the addresses stored therein. You can"t enter any address which you need to go. Most of the importa nt streets, locations are not even stored in that. May be only New Delhi NCR is mapped. Why then they are selling cars in Chennai and south? 2) First we were told infotainment radio and music features can be controlled by using mobile as remote by downloading an app. After car was bought we were told there is no app which can connect music radio in the car. The lack of this in a premium car is disappointing. Other premium cars have it. They charge Rs 13 lakhs. But these basic features absent.K
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;18 Aug 2020;Cecil Davis;4.3; Family Car ;Good leg space , boot space , smooth and comfortable while driving . Mileage on highways 18 km/ltr unlike they promised and very poor on cities . You get a pleasant drive if 2-3 people sitting . If 4-5 people sitting or if you have extra load inside boot then car lags much and wont give you a smooth drive especially with those suspensions which act good with less load but when load is heavy then g iving poor performance . I owns a petrol automatic variant .
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;8 Sep 2020;Coach Swamy;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car;Feels like Un-Maruti, i.e. fantastic build quality, tremendous space & very comfortable ride. Ease of driving, even in mad city traffic is a given for any Maruti, but in terms of the owner 'feeling good' inside the car, this is probably the first Maruti to feel so. I've switched from an XUV500 to Ciaz, but haven't regretted it yet. A bit more power & a sixth gear will make Ciaz the King of 'full s ize' sedans.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;24 May 2019;Guru Pramodh;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It's a scintillating machine by maruti Suzuki till date 💯❤️.The design language is just top notch.It turns me very good mileage at this size and price point.they haven't compromised any elements in this car. The music system is decent.comfort level is just super cool.You get a huge leg room.very large boot capacity,premium interiors and what not. They even provide some segment missing featu res in base trim that's.Really appreciable. Beige treatment,wooden finish what not. Very comfortable driving position. It's a clear VFM car for this segment. It's an heart touching car of mine and my family as well. The broad stance and elegant look. Finally- this is CIAZ(lot more to confess but it's seems to be enough for me😅😂).The best car of maruti Suzuki 💯❤️☮️
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;14 Dec 2020;Dinesh Lalwani;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Performance and mileage are good, Comfort and styling are best.But there are two things i would like to highlight that is 1)the brightness of the headlights is low, Even there are projector lamps but during night driving it gives a lot of problems this is the thing we generally can't check during test drives.2) the pillars of the car are very broad it hampers a lot of vision during road crossing a nd taking turns.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;8 Aug 2019;PRIYANSHU AG..;1.3; Daily Commute ;The Worst material and services used in India in any car that is Maruti.. one day it will become like Nokia.. they never saw the safety features and strongness in car made of complete worst material. Even Maruti also is thief in justifying themselves in mileage. They claim Ciaz Milage of 29.2 KMPL, whereas actual mileage is 18 KMPL on the highway, service part also worst.. I can write more than 10 pages over service portion. average regular service cost is 12,000- 15,000..this car is worst in performance, it is made of poor material, touch on small breaker.. worst suspension and shocker.. and steering will be hard like truck steering.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;15 Nov 2019;Ajay Joshi;4.3; Daily Commute ;Its a smart looking economically priced car. Have decent build quality and average power but for the price its a steal and is not very high on maintenance. Average cost of service from company is 10 G's. Also the car is ultra spacious for 5 people and boot is also very big. Overall its a good car to buy for daily use. Its smart hybrid feature is uber cool.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;13 Oct 2020;Zaid Siddiqui;4.3; Family Car | Tours ;Ciaz is a very comfortable car and offer a ton of features but some are lacking though it is very good car for long highway journeys and is powerful enough with it's 1.3 multijet diesel to make fast overtakes This sedan due to ita dynamic design can a top speed of 200 kmph which is pretty fast as per the price on which it is offered.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;30 Sep 2020;Vichal Singh;4.7; Daily Commute ;Good value for money car, OK milage... robustness is what i admire in particular...have driven 40k now...all kinds of terrains...rough road, no road...seems that it take anything without much fuss... Only thing lacking in Diesel Alpha smart hybrid that i like is...lack of power..when climbing in hill roads...Rest no issues...
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;10 Sep 2020;Shail Aggarwal;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;stylish car by maruti in market in comparison to other competitors product in this type first car of maruti which gained public on price product features and looks .good decent car and if talk about other cars of maruti you see they are buyed b everyone but ciaz is a premium car bought by high end class people
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;8 Mar 2020;Meherzaad Wykes;4.7; Daily Commute ;The best sedan in its price range and lot better than its rivals far best by a mile . Mileage , Length , Looks , Wheelbase , Features at the price , Nexa Blue color is Killer 🔥 !!!!! i have the Alpha petrol top model variant and it is the best and the most dashing of them all sedans out there.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;4 Oct 2020;Ganesh Thant..;4.7; Family Car ;Over all superb and fantastic for middle class people it's very worth for money but couple of disadvatages are their led projector light adjustment is not their so it's very hard to drive for long trip in night time we can't cross 80 in unknown roads and poor plastic build quality....
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;12 Dec 2018;ABHEYKUMAR B..;5.0; Daily Commute ;I have Purchased this Car in Jan 2017, I have travelled on long tours via this car, really great experience that i have got, this is amazing machine manufactured by Maruti, This is very comfortable in Long Travellings, Considering Engine Power this machine has great Pickup & I have drive this max speed of 185 KM/Hour, mileage wise this car is giving average of 25+ on highways, & 15+ in City. This is the most efficient car in this segment. Style wise & Feature wise this is really great car.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;6 Oct 2020;Lonely Musafir;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Ciaz gives you space to relax your body and joints with some decent external looks. It is light on your pocket and is extremely fuel efficient. But it lags good safety features and has a tremendous power lag with 5 passengers on board.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;24 Nov 2019;Sumanth Bhat;4.3; Daily Commute ;Ciaz, as the name indicates- Is built for comfort, luxury and best selling sedans of India because of its performance and styling.

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;20 Dec 2020;ASHON VIILs;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Worst steering ever to be very frank. It doesn't even feel like a power steering that's how bad it is. The infotainment system is also bad as it mostly unable to connect to phone and couldn't load the contacts.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;23 Nov 2020;Shubham Garg;4.7; Family Car ;Awesome car m tottally satisfied with performance ride quality features boot space is too much and rear leg space feels like you are in home.So much space then verna just go with it and enjoy your super machine.

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;23 Mar 2020;HiranJith Kp;4.3; Daily Commute ;A better option for a family sedan. lots of space is given and better riding comfort. the engine is not much performance oriented but the turbo once kicks the car will flow agressivly..

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;19 Nov 2019;Shyam Gopi;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Buying experience:Being a Nexa exclusive product, the process to purchase the car was extremely smooth. In addition, Nexa showrooms are capable of doing a fair bit of modifications so that is an added bonus.Drivability & Performance:The wheelbase is slightly intimidating but once you're in the driver's seat, it is extremely comfortable to drive through city as well as highway. It's got plenty of t orque so in gear acceleration makes it a pleasant experience as opposed to having to downshift constantly to pull ahead and overtake.Mileage:City mileage of 15kmpl and highway mileage of 18kmpl is quite decent considering a 1.5 liter petrol engine. With a tank capacity of approximately 40 liters, you only need to fill every 500 kms or so.Highway:The one con with this engine is that it lacks top-end performance. While it's quite adequate, the enthusiast may not find it interesting enough.Biggest positive:The suspension! It is just right. Neither too soft, nor too hard. Despite the relatively low ground clearance, it tackles speed bumps and bad roads really really well.Overall:A premium look and ride quality, and a very aggressive, competitive pricing makes this absolute value for money.

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;24 Jun 2019;Vishnu Prasad;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;The car is around 5 years old and it’s a diesel 1.3 motor which has completed 1 lakh 10 thousand kilometres till now and is going strong. Regular service is done without a miss and at 1 lakh 5 thousand kilometres for the first time clutch and tyres are replaced, rest all in stock condition. It returns a fuel efficiency of 14-15 in city with ac in Bangalore and 20-22 on highways with 4 people, fu ll time ac and luggage while cruising at speeds of 90-120.Rattling issues are moderately present, goes off and comes alive on its own, I have not got it repaired. Ride, space and comfort while cruising is appreciated but it’s not a Driver’s car. The new ciaz has got many improvements over its predecessor which I own one. Ground clearance could be improved as it has long wheelbase and front bumper height and approach angle should improve to avoid scraping at basements parking areas

MarutiSuzuki;Eeco;18 Jan 2020;Jay Rajput;4.0; Family Car ;I have bought Eeco van and it's best VAN for the middle class family. apart from that I also like the 1.2 liter engine it's gives you batter driveablelity the city as well on the highway you can't feel any lag in the engine when it's come to mileage this VAN will gives you mileage 14 KMPL with AC and 16 KMPL with out AC depanding on your driving style. And Eeco gets soft suspension setup which are really nice if car is loaded and if you driving on the bad road but if you driving alone then ride quality get little bit bounce.
MarutiSuzuki;Eeco;1 Oct 2020;Rajan V;2.7; Family Car ;Performance of AC is very low. Dealers informed that being van type customer should not expect more like car. Also, whenever there is a break down. Road side assistance is very very poor. First they ask distance from their show room and immediately compel to bring the vehicle through toe vehicle and the charge would be Minimum Rs.2000/-. If we go and repair by engaging local mechanic the expense w ould be around 300 to 400 rupees ony. Whatever we say, they tell same like repetition and not at all hear our problems.
MarutiSuzuki;Eeco;7 Aug 2020;Jo;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;it is going to revolutionise our logistics as a small fish..as a commercial vehicle it's the talk of town..with small turning radius..quick up ..great mileage..Suzuki got all right as a freezer van...delivery van..a small family car too..its mileage in petrol eda a headache.. cng kit is good...just wait..

MarutiSuzuki;Eeco;7 Mar 2019;Tharamel Tha..;4.7; Daily Commute ;5 seater ac cng so is underpowered when ac is on full blast in peak of summer and guzzles petrol and gas ,so mileage falls to 10 per litre of petrol and 15 per kg of gas and as volume of vehicle is large ac appears ineffectived in summer ,another impt draw back is lack of power steering which was present on the versa ,so all in all vfm and defenitely a better upgrade from omni lpg which was my fir st vehicle

MarutiSuzuki;SwiftDzireTour;8 Dec 2020;Saurav Wadhwa;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I got the maruti suzuki swift dzire, 2008 model, In 2012, It was a premium sedan at that time and it had power windows, Reverse parking sensors interior wood trims which complemented the car.But after driving the car on the roads of mumbai it wasn't as pleasant, The car didn't take the bumps very, As compared to an ertiga.The performance is good enough for city or highways, Can easily drive up to 140 kmph, And has great acceleration.My car also had airbags and many other safety features as standard which still in 2020 makes up for it being an old car.

Safety is excellant ,abs saved me three times when I suppose to hit back side of bus for sudden braking without indication while going in highway at a speed of 120 .I recommend to buy this one and suggest to not goin speed as in turnings it may topple due to less weight.Interiors superb and music system outstanding .Enjoying driving and I feel good.

MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;28 Jan 2019;Lalit Bhati;4.3; Daily Commute ;I have driven my baleno almost 40000km till now. It has been a good car till date but there is some issues with its build quality, build quality is not up to the mark. I always get overall milage up to 22-23km/l. On highway you can get better milage up to 30km/l but depends on your driving habits.. overall I am happy with Baleno. I want to request Maruti kindly improve it's build quality.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;5 Dec 2018;Yatin Prabha..;1.3; Family Car;This car is not safe for long drive. All parts are made of plastic and body is not tough. Due to that reason when you drive a car on highways if other car passes through you. Your car vobbles. Secondly average is 12 km on highway and 9 km in city petrol version.. which is really disgusting to me., overall I am not at all satisfy with this car.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;9 Jan 2019;Prabhashanka..;4.0; Family Car ;A good car worth its value. Mine is zeta 1.2 petrol version. Mileage has not gone below 16 km.in city driving.

MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;16 Jan 2020;Nishant Parmar;2.7; Family Car | Tours;I am a professional driver and having total car driving experience of 13 years in my life. I am writing this review about my S-Cross (Delta) by Maruti Suzuki at 24000 km (2 years and 5 months)First of all, I would suggest not to waste your valuable money in this car. If your budget is around 10 lacks, in the market there are few cars which you have to find out and make your car experience worth. C oming to the point : Cons : 1. According to body, the 1.3 ltr engine is not capable. But you know that Maruti has (EK hi Khet ki Muli) only n only 1.3 lts diesel engine whether it is any diesel car. When car is fully loaded with 5 person and luggage at backside, the power and pickup is really very weak. 2. The body : This car's body is like a PAPER. That mean not safe at all on highway, after all it is all about our life safety and if the car has a body like a PAPER, you can think about. The iron material which company has used in this car is worst. The Fiber material is like a scrap which they have used in a new condition. Car Jack kit is not user friendly at all. 3. All glasses (Front, rear and all other windows) are also very slim. 4. The horn is very very very light. According to body and price, company should have given a good quality horn which can be used on highway and everywhere.5. Handbrake is just like a toy. Not useful at all on slope. 6. Dashboard material also very weak compared to other companies. Not safe at all. 7. The material is very light weight and cheap so that overall car weight is also lowest according to body size. 8. The same KEY for all maruti cars. If you buy alto in 3 lacks then also the same key will be given. Not giving that personality (Seems DESI). 9. For better driving, steering grip with horn should be more comfortable for drivers. Here it is not. --------------------------------------------------------Pros : 1. Good boot space. Can keep more luggage very easily. 2. Good braking system (All Tyre disk brakes)3. Mileage is OK. 15-16 in city and 20-21 on highway (with AC)4. Very specious from every angle. Space makes journey peaceful.5. Engine is good only after shifting to 5th gear. 6. 50 Ltr Diesel tank which is good for long journey.7. The music system and sound quality is OK. Not bat but NOT BEST also. ---------------------------------------------------------------Overall opinion : Rather than going for S-Cross, I would suggest to go for 1. Hyundai Creta2. Ford Ecosport3. Ford Freestyle4. Skoda Rapid5. Mahindra XUV 3006. Mahindra TUV 3007. Mahindra Thar8. Kia SeltosIn short, I would say that if you see a person, doesn't mean that he/she should be beautiful. He/she should be 'HEALTHY'. Don't judge the car assuming that this car looks very big size and price is Rs. 10 lacks, will definitely a very good car. Sorry if you are a S-Cross owners but I am also the same like you. Thanks.
MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;10 Feb 2020;Muthiah Samb..;4.0; Daily Commute;Bought scross diesle 1.3 ltr on 2019-Feb and has been using it since. Estimate for 3rd free service was Rs.5048 (Parts - 3048 and Labor - 2000 ) @ Yelahanka Nexa (Bengaluru). When asked why labor is charged even in free service, I was told that wheel alignment/balancing and tire rotation does not fall in the service labor category. MARUTI/NEXA - Being a reputable company, should not hide these fac ts during sales, but sadly they do.Performance of the vehicle - averageBengaluru City Mileage - 12 to 15 kmplOutside Mileage (long drives) - 17 - 20 kmplWheel turn radius - Needs improvement (have difficulties while making u-turn)Comfort - 5 people can sit comfortably (3 + 2), makes it a stand out when compared to other cars in this segmentSuspension - Needs improvements - Even going at 5 - 8 kmph speed, car suspension does not do justice, when the tire goes through p*t holesSpecial features - Cruise control, steering based audio controls, instant mileage display, rear parking sensors are good to have in this car7 inch LCD - Needs improvement in the inbuilt map (as no service center performs map updates)
MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;27 Jun 2019;Tobing Perme;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Cons: 1.This car as everybody points out need a bigger powerful engine to justify its brilliant chassis. 2.There are quality issues like body rattles, squeezing sounds from driver seat etc. 3. A rear Air-con vent is a big miss although AC is descent. 4. Turning Radius is a big disappointment. Even a bigger car in Scorpio has got a better turning radius.5. engine noise insulation could"ve been bett er.6. Approach angle is too aggressive and it is the only soar point that is vulnerable from getting hit in deep sharp bumps. A better approach angle will surely do wonders for it though it is city focused.7. I found tyres to wear off very quickly. I had to change them at 20k.Pros.1. Ride quality is brilliant. 2. Once you understand the car as a whole, you can do a lot of stuffs with it. most of the off-roadings other than extreme conditions can be done if you take care of the approach angle.3. Ground clearance is good enough if you drive carefully off tarmac and take care of front skid plate.4. Space is adequate for 5.5. Returns good mileage.6. Maintenance cost is on the lower side.7. It is a VFM car. most people compare it to creta SX(O) which is unfair but when you see it at the price point in which the top trim Alpha comes, it sways away creta in every aspect other than build quality.
MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;17 Dec 2019;Jimeet Shah;1.0; Daily Commute;I am using this car since June 2019 . I am a very cautious driver . Almost no scratches on my car . Car has just travelled 9,000 kms from mumbai and I am the only sole driver of this car .The Cluth gear has already been burned out and I had to spend rs 9,500 in just about 18 months . I have Full 3 years warranty but it doesn’t cover these charges ! Super disappointed by this product ! And very s peedy response from nexa to even attend my vehicle . A sad buyer .never buy nexa . I have other brand cars as well , all are with me since 10 years and none of them have made us pay for cluth gear before 50,000 kms . This vehicle just got its gear worned our in 18 month s???
MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;7 Apr 2020;Rajeev Prabhu;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Its six months now since we have been using a Scross delta 2019 model. I can blindly say its the best car i have used till date from maruti after Ritz. In between i owned the 2018 dzire vdi,but was disappointed with its height,ride,etc. So changed to scross. Very much satisfied. Its not at all under powered. I too heard this statement from many reviews saying it lacks power,in comparison maybe yes . But do you go racing? I certainly feel its a comfortable car for long journeys. It falls above the compact suv segment,so that extra tax. Returns a mileage of 18kmpl in normal driving conditions. Top speed :180+ kmph.
MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;14 Aug 2018;Abhay Kapadnis;4.7; Family Car ;As it is excellent car.mileage is superb it gives about 18-20 in city and 22-23 on highways.it front chrome grill gives a perfect SUV like experience.when I purchased across it waiting period was about 3 month and the stupid dealership delayed more but not giving sufficient information .nexa service centre has transperancy in their work(when car is service d we can see from the room attached to th e car servicing chamber).across has very good leg room,height,shoulder comfort (more than creta,capture,brezza,ecosport).it longer than creta but height is shooter overall is a scoss.its servicing cost is about 5000.scross a/c is very cooling even in hot condition.the main drawback is the engine (sufficient) not have more power.it lacks much but in city scross is a best choice but for highways enthusiastic not a proper choice .scross (I noticed) door are lit bit heavy.shvs technology is very power saving.
MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;4 Nov 2019;Aditya On;4.7; Family Car | Tours ;The Varient I bought back in 2018 was S Cross Zeta. The car is way better in styling than its competitors and comes with a real 4 people spacious cabin. The car is really fun to drive and is easily maintainable. But the mileage the company claims of 25kmpl has not been delivered out throughout the year. The car gives hardly between 12 to 16 kmpl max. of fuel efficiency. Keeping this factor aside, its really the best product Suzuki India even sold.
MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;10 Mar 2020;Deepan Das;1.3; Family Car;Do not purchase nexa s cross...spare part cost is too much high compare to other other car ( creta or Ford car)...

MarutiSuzuki;SCross20172020;22 Apr 2020;Muthukumar R..;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;One word - Average.pros : Price, Buying experience with Nexa, Milage, Spacious interiors.cons : very average front look (mine is 1st gen SCrosz. New one looks fabulous), engine noise, road noise, pathetic OEM tyres - I had changed to Yokohama, relatively high service cost, 1.3L 89BHP engine is not at all good enough for the car of its size, very low boot space.

MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;13 Jan 2020;Zozo Zoe;4.3; Tours ;I really had a superb experience with my vitara. Although offroading was a tough on it went pass through it while tearing off my lower body guards. Everything is excellent with the brezza but a little weak in performance on hills other then that it really cruises around on perfect soiled roads. One thing I would like to see on future upgrades is the ground clearance with 200 mm, with bigger alloy size like 17 inch, rear boot space should be expand by increasing length width breadth of the car while adding more bold looks like the old grand vitara with sunroof led tail lamps offering LCD touch and keyless on 2nd top models and not only do plus options. The rest its perfect
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;22 Feb 2020;Mangesh Pada..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Good car to drive in city as well as on highway, I have zdi model, it misses out on one featus automatically folding mirrors witch I think would be handy in heavy city traffic but it has good visibility please and also has a big mirrors to have good view behind. car is also good to drive on long route and it's very comfortable, but if your are a kin drive you will come to know that it's under powe r in ghats section, and also feel a bit nurvousness at higher speeds more then 120km because the staring becomes lighter and shakes a bit on a minar road patches. but it has a good bild quality and also has a good mileage of 24kmpl if driven properly😁.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;17 Dec 2020;Gourab Kundu;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Best car in terms of price.If some one maintain the car it will give the best performance.Overall handling is very good.Comfort is descent.Mileage is the best part, Maximum mileage we achived 28kmpl.Overall good car.I changed all the four tyres at 1lack + kms.The stock tyres lasted 1lack + kms.As per the service centre we have to change the timing belt at 1lack + kms.One suggestion for every brezz a owners: refuel the car before the warning light turns on because if you run the car at low fuel it will damage your high pressure pump which costs around 40, 000.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;4 Sep 2019;Alex Thomas;3.3; Family Car ;Faulty transmission from the very first day. Reverse and first gear noisy and gear slips in inclined road. Transmission system light goes on. Done only 9500 kms. The dealer admitted that it is a manufacturing defect. Thanks to the service manager of Popular Vehicles, Kottayam. Now in garage for complete clutch replacement. Don't know whether it will resolve the problem. Disappointed about AMT syst em. Otherwise comfortable on road. Long journey gives 23 kms/lit with AC and in town 13kms/lit. Generally poor customer care services.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;7 Feb 2020;Somtirtha Ba..;3.7; Daily Commute ;Convenient but the AGS/AMT is not robust . Sometimes it can’t figure out which gear to choose and overheats in bumper to bumper traffic 80% of the time . Worth considering only if it comes with a new engine and proper auto box (torque converter or cvt). My daily commute is 50kms from west to east Pune , ergonomics and features are good , mileage is decent but I’d be happier if the AmT didn’t keep overheating all the time prompting me to stop
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;14 May 2019;Shubham Kash..;1.7; Daily Commute ;Waste Of Money Engine is too much under powered even other brand small car have more powerful engines (totally under powered for such a big car)Poor build quality, Poor interior quality,Seats are too much hard and uncomfortable feels back pain in long drives.Suspension is too much stiff.Ride quality is pathetic even maruti 800 is better than this .rear passenger may get dead in long journeys😂 a ll road surface feels in it.Maintenance of 8 -10 k for normal service and 10-15 k for major service is high for such a 3d class car. Average in normal driving conditions hardly gives 15 16 kmpl.To much rattles wind noise engine noise inside cabin, poor feel inside. Totally flop only looks, technically flop.....Totally waste of product not worth of 5 lakh even entry level cars are much better than this
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;19 Jan 2021;Rk Rekha;4.3; Family Car ;The car is good, The mileage is good, Comfort is good, Th e mileage depends how you drive, The car will be good if it get a sunroof, More features should be added if you go for brezza buy the top variant the prices also got increased in 2021, But the thing is the 2020 variant and 2021 variant are same not asingle change.You can also go for sonet, Xl6.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;4 Nov 2019;Aditya On;4.3; Family Car | Tours ;Bought the Brezza Zdi+ variant. The car was a real fun to drive. The car was really cool with its looks and the mileage it delivered. Good for 4 people in cabin. The car really has a good riding position as the driver can easily have the view of the end to end view of the bonnet. That looks awesome. Do buy this if you prefer a fun high profile ride.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;5 Nov 2019;Sunjeet Bhadana;3.3; Daily Commute;Before 2nd service no issues. After my 2nd service, I observed that the pickup had gone completely. Next day again car sent with the complaint to service. Issue detected clutch worn out. They are replacing it for free. However, it is disappointing and I am apprehensive about the future of brezza AMT as a model. AMT seems to have a reliability issue
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;17 Sep 2020;Gamer Or;3.0; Family Car ;The company claims of 24+ mileage but it gave only 16-18 mileage on highways and 13-16 on common roads but i am happy with the car as it's external and internal looks and it's mechanical alloy wheels and a 1246 cc powerful engine with 5 speed manual transmission and overall I am happy with the car. Thanks to Maruti Suzuki!!
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;24 Nov 2019;Harshit Garg;5.0; Daily Commute ;I had a swift earlier then I wished to buy a compact SUV and I thought of this car. The overall performance and mileage of the car is just awesome,Being larger than swift it offers more mileage. Only thing that need to be improved is the quality of the dashboard. I m a happy Maruti customer.☺☺
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;29 Jun 2020;Prajodh Menon;4.3; Family Car | Tours ;Vitara Brezza is meant for long distance drives. Quite stable and can comfortably cruise to 120 continuously with a decent mileage. 26.4 kmpl, is the mileage which i have benchmarked in my Pune-Bengaluru-Palakkad trip for the last 2 years at a nice constant speed of 100kmph. Awesome!!
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;20 Feb 2019;Hrithik John;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;As the name says brezza is a beast on the highway it gets to triple digit speeds quite often very quickly. Driving in a ghat or curvy road is delight as the car has a lot of grip and stablity in in the city if you go through narrow streets then it gives you an alround proper visiblity and the ground clearance of mammoth 200mm is great as you don"t need bother about road beneath you. If you have a go anywhere attitude then this should be your pick and also the tax benefits too help in giving it an edge over its competition.

MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;19 Jun 2019;Joseph Amalraj;4.3; Occasional Commute ;Feels comfortable on bumpy roads. Good infotainment features including speaker quality. The Zdi+ variant covers many features and so there is no need for spending extra money on accesories. The doors are lightweight. I prefer heavy doors safe in case of impact from.side. Dashboard material is flimsy and very low quality. GPS is voice activated and cannot enter key words by typing. Pick up is not t o the expectation. Good for family inside city drive, less maintenance cost and good fuel efficiency.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;10 May 2019;Kuldeep Singh;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;गाड़ी 10 लाख में ठीक है। माइलेज हाईवे पर 24 तक का देती है। सिटी में भी ठीक ही है 18 तक। जितनी बाहर से शानदार है उतना अंदर से मजा नहीं आता। अंदर आल्टो जैसी है। माइल ेज और resale में इसकी कोई टक्कर नहीं।

MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;22 Oct 2019;Vinay Saraswat;3.0; Daily Commute ;With an engine of 1.2 L the SUV feels like under power. Built quality is extrem poor. I would suggest to go with i20 instewd of Brezza or go with Eco sport or Hyndai Venue if you can go with a little higher budget.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;20 Dec 2020;AMARJIT SINGH;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;All door closed mechanism is very poor and riding on rough road is poor, Like different type of interior and exterior noises are heared and loose the control while fast driving.Otherwise the car is very good.

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;19 Jan 2021;Shriram Salunke;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;For the starter, Lets start with the pros - great styling and interiors.It looks modern when you seat in the car.- space in front and back seat is very good and with armrest in back seat adds to more comfort.It also has rear ac.- very silent, Reliable and fuel efficient engine which also contributes to extremely low nvh levels in car.- very easy to drive and offers good ride quality be it on city roads or bad roads- driver seat height adjuster is very good features and lets you adjust perfect driving position- steering mounted controls it helps you control music system as well as answer calls with ease.- last but not the least, Maruti have largest network of service centers and getting any spares in part of country is not a hassle.- offers platinum extended warranty for extra cost for 100000 or 5yrs which ever is earlier.Now the cons:1.Poor build quality, In terms of sheet metal used is very thin and may be safety issue.The metal sheet seems very flimsy.2.Beige flooring which is really difficult to maintain.3.Storage box in the dashboard is comparatively small and is not cooled.4.Stock head lamps could have been brighter.It is ok for city conditions but on highways you will feel the need to upgrade with brighter and better bulbs.5.Rear ac does not have enough throw.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;13 Jan 2021;Shubroto Munshi;4.3; Tours;I own my swift dzire for around 4 years now till now this car hasn't caused me any trouble regard to its engine and suspension. it has also completed more that 2 lakh kilometres as it being used by our touring company.maintenance cost is low parts are available easily their is no problem with mileage it does 20-23 kmpl. even after 4 years it's 4 cylinder engine is quite cherpy and agressive. if yo u want to be the first one to go after the signal turns green this would definitely help you. it's also got a good storage capacity that can hold upto 2 big suitcases and 3 small suitcases easily. it does lack into modern day features but during that time with that price point it was a awesome car to own.

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;3 Mar 2020;Marc Thomas;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;we bought the dzire in 2012 and it still have that shine⭐✨ because of it's naturally aspirated i-4, with VVT, which swirls out to post 6000rpm, which today's turbocharged car misses out. it's still comfy and easy to drive car. mileage is good enough, even when it is over 8 years old. my car have done 32000kms in odo, what it had lost is initial low end torque, and power (if we compare to today 's cars). but I'm still happy with this beauty of an i-4 as it still have that symphony of VVT's 6k RPM..... :)
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;1 Sep 2020;Pranav J;5.0; Occasional Commute | Tours ;I use WRV for my long tours and use my swift diesel for daily commute. I must say the I-VTEC engine is one of the best petrol engine i have ever driven. Some people said the power is not enough which made me skeptic about buying it at first, but in my opinion that is just prejudice . The power is more than enough. TATA nexon gives more power but in the long run TATA Nexon engines will have lesser life because Honda keeps it cool without stressing the hardware.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;20 Jan 2021;Tarunaditya ..;3.3; Daily Commute ;The car is nice with a pretty good pick up but additional weight of the trunk on a small engine is a bit more than required.Also the quality of body is not so good.Suspension system is also not up to the mark.Driving above 80kmph is a kinda red zone for the vehicle as handling becomes difficult for sharp cuts and curves.Overall a good vehicle for those who love a simple and soft drive.Also the car is a big no for bumpy roads.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;15 Nov 2019;Vivek Chandel;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;This car has some undying charm with it. Never faced a single issue regarding handling/electricals/engine. Being used regularly on fairly rough roads but nothing ever gives in. Also have done some long tours, and every single time this companion has proved trustworthy. Really a well-balanced car overall between comfort, mileage and power. Satisfies occassional cravings for a spirited driving beaut ifully with its eager turbo.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;13 Oct 2019;Mercy Johny;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Overall it is a nice compact sedan which satisfies basic needs which is an apt choice for a nuclear family. In the case of its service which could be available at a desirable priceOne of its drawback/ suggestion to be made is increase its boot space, rear seat legroom and quality of its bumpersAnyway it is a gift from god with which meets all the necessary factors like comfort, beauty and mileage
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;11 Jun 2020;Manoj Parmar;4.0; Family Car ;Maruti cars has impression that its easy to own. But as per the current situation showroom service is worst and also build quality issue is there. So it is better to go for other option if you required this 2 things. My service and other maintenance is never done by the showrooms in first visit. Owning a maruti car is no more peace of mind now a days.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;23 Mar 2020;Mreenmoy Halder;4.7; Daily Commute ;Amt varient vdi has great peak up, mileage is also good, in Highway with uniform speed of 90km/hr it gives a mileage of 29 km/ ltr, and average speed of 100 to 140 km/ hr gives mileage of 21-23 km/ltr. I had installed obd car tracker separately so that I can track my vehicle health, current location and mileage of each trip.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;13 Jan 2021;Innovative C..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Overall performance is good.Mileage is pretty good like if you drive within 80km damn sure that over 20 mileage comfort is super good.Boot space and leg space is very good opt for this.Inside the budget also a fast moving car in india company service is good its pretty safe with high quality metal that is used for the car.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;15 May 2020;Ram Bhupal;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It is a very stress free vehicle to trafel at a stretch 500 KM a day. Maintenance is very soft and it never troubled me in the previous 6 years. However I am going to change the vehicle as it is becoming old and there new variants in the Market. Otherwise it is really a very efficient and decent vehicle for a family of 4.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;5 Dec 2020;Guhan Kumanan;1.7; Daily Commute;poor performance way too much lag , improper seats for tall drivers , and brakes are wayyyyy tooo spongy. music system failed in just five years inspite of very rare usage. and vibrates a lot when the speed exceeds 100 kmph. Door rests in rear break easily. Not a car for spirited drive, suited for taxi segment
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;12 Feb 2020;Abhijnan Raj;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Car is loud when you start , mid range of the car is fine. Talking about comfort small kids and people with height of 6ft would be comfortable people taller than that can have lack of head room and under thigh support. Handling of Swift Dzire is just EXCELLENT . Top speed is around 184 -185 as recorded by me.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;3 Apr 2020;Wonder Hobbies;4.3; Family Car;Very Good Car in dis price segment although metal quality is stilll no upto the mark like i20 but still Overall Value For Money product but consider only petrol because deisel variant is not only more expensive sooo dosent justifies its price one can get higher segment ciaz if loking for a deisel variant

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;14 Jan 2021;Shriram Salunke;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Looks, Modern pleasing interior, Comfort, Spacious, Ride quality, Very silent and smooth engine.The only complaint is build quality.Sheet metal of the car leaves lot to be dzired.Customer won't mind 40-50 odd more kgs but sturdy sheet metal would certainly go long way in safety of overall body.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;5 Sep 2019;Mayank Sabnani;1.3; Daily Commute ;There are only three reasons to buy this car 1- fuel efficient - because of bad build quality which has resulted weight loss of car2- spacious cabin3 - engine has long lifeRest everything is worst about this car - performance , features , safety , pricing , etc.Most unsafest car of its range

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;3 Mar 2020;Ankit Gupta;3.0; Occasional Commute;i am overall satisfied with the Dzire, but one thing that Dzire or in fact all maruti car lags in the build Quality. To improve the fuel efficiency Maruti has downgraded the quality to such an extent that if feels really unsafe to take a maruti car on a highway

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;7 Dec 2020;Jose Thomas;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;More or less satisfying in all aspects.A good car for middle-class families.I could be designed with a bit more legroom for the ones sitting at the back seat.Rearview mirror could be larger boot space is rather small for a family.

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;24 Apr 2019;Stonewall Va..;4.3; Family Car ;It"s the best affordable sedan for a middle class family with lots of space in the interior and boots too. But the problem with the company is that,they should make airbags and rear view camera compulsory with ABS as every body who wants swift dzire would automatically buy it.Now only top models are provided with airbags,ABS,and rear view camera..why the company makes it differ with its models in terms of accessories.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;14 Nov 2020;Rajaseelan C..;5.0; Daily Commute ;This is a very good car for personnel use as well as official use.I move around a lot.Relaxed driving.No fatigue vehicle.Feed yourself and just fill the tank, Do the regular maintenance.I just puchased and rode safely.

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;12 Jun 2019;Kiran Gnanaiah;4.3; Daily Commute ;I love its smoothness. I have owned this car for 3 years now and still love it. Driver and front passenger seats are excellent. Back seating is a little cramped for a tall person; headroom for back passengers is low.I've still not learnt all the nifty features of my car! Ideal for daily commute to work, especially as I can escape the scorching heat and also the rain (during rainy seasons like now) .
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire20172020;7 Jun 2020;Satyam Bajpai;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;car breaking is not good that is big issu in car....poor breaking...and build quality very poor...in this price compare to othar segment car Maruti did not give u features cost cutting in every material..

MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;24 Apr 2019;JAI MISHRA;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Its an AMT .Use for Daily office 8 KM + 8 KM= 16KM daily in bumper traffic takes more than 1 hour to reach 8 KM, in such situation gives a mileage of 12KM / Litter of petrol with out AC. Easy to drive in bumper traffic , no Need to press accelerator to move few yard in traffic just run on removing the break. As no gear , hence no thinking about changing gear and pressing clutch.No need to think wh at will happen if clutch and accelerator will not match. As i am using the same from 11 months, hence no cost till now on service. Being compact , Easy to Park and turn in small space. Good AC. Equipped with Driver side airbag, seat belt indicator. open door indicator etc. Alarm will ring if key removed without switching of head light. Manual central locking facility means all door will be closed in case of driver door is closed. child look will open only on removing key from ignition. Ignition will not work unless gear is not moved to neutral so protect ignition switch. Good ground clearance.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;3 Jan 2021;Bishal Karmakar;2.0; Daily Commute ;I am not happy with my alto k10 vxi 2018 mt model.But i have to spend my precious time with this one just because of my car buying budget isse.Please go for another brands another model for pure driving pleasure' comfort and reliability.If you have concern about 'kitna deti hai' and 'after sales service network' then you have to suffer like me and my family.' indian comes home in a maruti suzuki' happy motoring to all of you, Who sees this post.Thank you.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;3 Jan 2020;Arvind Bharti;3.7; Daily Commute ;Alto k10 is a good Car for daily commute in heavy city traffic.I feel Seats are not comfortable which can be improved and interior plastic quality and switches quality should be improved. Otherwise it is good option for replacing two wheeler. What we can expect in this price . But mileage is best. I am getting mileage of 24 kmpl on highway. Hope company will improve this car as and when required.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;18 Oct 2020;Sumedh Deshp..;5.0; Family Car;It is a very good value car. Feels very well. Reliability is very good. Even after being off for one day, it starts quickly. Looks good. The engine is still very peppy even after 8 years of use. Very cool to have. Fuel efficiency figures have not dropped noticeably. Still does 20 kmpl on highways. Overall awesome car.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;22 May 2020;Mohinder Duggal;3.7; Family Car;Overall I happy with this car,but we exchanged our old Maruti 800 and dealer C M AUTO CHANDIGARH had held up Re 5000 which were required to be refunded after the old car to new owner since the old car bearing regd no CH01X5766 stands transferred but dealer has norefundede 5000 plus Interest. So far inspite of my numberless visit to dealer.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;7 Nov 2019;Bhargav Mankad;4.3; Family Car ;Its a good car for the price you pay. We use for a 4 adult+ Kid trips of more than 04 days and believe me, if you pack well, you can carve out space for shopped items on the way back home. But rattling is an issue even the service center people acknowledge not being resolved which developes after some use.Over all big recommendation.!!
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;16 Aug 2019;Deepak Singh;2.0; Occasional Commute ;Not a good car in any aspect. No space for luggage. Built quality is not satisfactory All doors are making noise. Even mileage is too less than what company is saying only 12kmpl Max on petrol. Better to spend 1 or 2 lakh more and get hyundai car which is far better than maruti. Seriously Disappointed. Not Recommended at all
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;7 Mar 2019;Sawmtea Khia..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I am driving my alto K10 vxi 2012 for 7 years now and last year(6th year) we went for a trip which was to our home town 610km but there was no over heat because of liquid cooled engine, we were 4 with luggage i could feel 6 people were sitting but not even a lag due to it's 1.0L engine, i would let you know the way was hill so you can guess how my car was tested. If you are looking for city rides and also sudden trips like me for 500-600kms then without any complain i would like to suggest you alto k10. Now for the down backs= the passenger side headrest isn't there which wasn't good, boot space is quiet less.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;15 Dec 2019;Mahesh Dhabhai;3.7; Daily Commute ;Good for daily office commute for two. Not much space on back seat. Punchy in terms of acceleration and torque output initially as it has higher weight to power ratio.Overall good city and best rural car with good ground clearance. Got security features like ABS and EBD makes it more sensible in this budget segment.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;15 Jan 2021;Adil shams;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Bought on 2016 september granite grey colour, Things which i feel as pro's are low maintenance cost, Good mileage and good performance, The con's which i felt is it has less space and comfort and safety is also not so good because airbags ain't available along with the car apart from that all good👍🏻❤️
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;17 May 2020;Muhammed Noufal;4.0; Family Car ;Safety wise its Zero, but in performance with small 1000cc engines its very torque engine. mileage is best and the maintenance cost is also same as to a sports bike. driving comfort is also very good. interior fit and finishing is average but as a middle class family its real budget car.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;16 May 2020;Vikas Kaushik;3.3; Daily Commute ;Alto k10 car is good car in it's segment powerful, good mileage better for city drive easily pass, good pickup. I can say that it's never ever disappoint me for my Dissision. It's a simple car not fancy eg bottle holder steering assisted stereo etc. But whatever it is looks cool.
MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;25 Dec 2019;R Himanshu;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;Great car. One of the best in the segment. Delivers an average of 20 kmpl on highways and 15-18 kmpl in city... Depending upon how you drive it. I've driven Jodhur to Haridwar (780 kms approx) and back to jodhpur with 2 stops and the ride quality was awesome.

MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;9 Aug 2020;Abhimanyu Rai;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Its a good and super vehicle but its low on space on driver seat overall for a middle class family its a jackpot because the performance and maintenance are super repair cost is low easy to maintain vehicle over all

MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;15 Nov 2018;Paul Javaid;2.0; Daily Commute ;The car has no sufficient interior space. Three persons are hardly accomodated on the rear seat. During cold mornings, the car engine takes much time to warm up,several times it goes off and we need to start it again and again. Moreover,when i start the car it emits smoke with bad smell and pungent to eyes.

MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;17 Jul 2019;Atul Mishra;2.0; Family Car;Best in its segment but people should be beware of the built quality and the safety in it.

MarutiSuzuki;AltoK10;22 Jun 2020;Saurav Kar;4.0; Daily Commute ;I am using this car for the past 4 years, mileage is very good even under hard driving, usually around 19 to 20 on highways, in traffic around 14 to 15 with a/c switched on. Performance is good, but the car being light, has to be kept under your control. Build quality not good and at last the front 2 seats are good, but the rear sit is very cramped specially for tall people. Overall for the price it is good car for the lower middle class in India.It sells in good numbers, servicing is cheap, spares are not coastly and it's easily available in both rural and urban areas of our country.

MarutiSuzuki;WagonR20012018;18 Jan 2019;APURVA RAI;3.0; Family Car ;Before deciding to buy WagonR I owned a Maruti 800. The "people"s car" brought many cheers in the family just like it has been doing for decades. After initial happiness we felt this is not sufficient for us and the reasons were many.We zeroed in for WagonR for various reasons. First and foremost was height. Tall boy concept made stepping in and stepping out much more easier than the M-800. Second ly, height provided better outside view particularly the driver.Second reason was large cabin. Once inside the vehicle you felt as if you are traveling with your family in a small compact room.Third factor was boot space. M-800 was good for city drive and your everyday shopping needs but not when you were travelling to another city with the entire family and the luggage. This is where WagonR suited most. Better boot space means you can attend a wedding in another city with your family.Even though I never admired the looks of WagonR I decided in its favour because of some useful reasons it offered.Even today I do not regret buying WagonR as it has given me great company and added an important symbol of status to my life.WagonR with 1.1 litre engine is better on highways than city. While driving in the crowded city like Delhi/NCR with air-conditioning on it is nightmarish to look at the petrol guage. However the vehicle is thrifty on highways. Even servicing is not reasonable. Labour cost, spares etc make sure you end up paying a good amount.As my needs have gone up I do not find its boot large enough to meet my expectations. One large suitcase and then it"s full leaving you worrying for more adjustments. I also felt that WagonR should have been fitted with larger and wider wheels for added safety.On an average this is a good first vehicle or a second family vehicle.
MarutiSuzuki;WagonR20012018;18 Oct 2020;Ajay Chauhan;4.0; Daily Commute;Wagon R was my good companion. I travelled in my Wagon from Delhi to Manali then Rohtang pass in single stratch.

MarutiSuzuki;Zen;9 Sep 2020;Suryansh Rana;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;its overall a good vehicle but if you are looking for performance or acceleration or top speed then it might hurt you but yeah the comfort of the car is very good and you can easily fit in 5 people comfortably and there is a little harm in the back row but that doesn't matter and the AC is not that good as the cars now get but yeah in a proper weather not in the extreme summer but if there is a go od weather it works properly and the plus point is that this car got heater also which is very beneficial in the winter season and the overall look is not bad but it could be better like not if you modify it then it will look extremely superb like I am is always on this car and like music system I regret purchasing 2001 model because in 2002 model there is side view mirror on the both side and you get music system and power steering and wheel cap but in 2000 model you do not get a wheel cap neither music system naye the both side view mirror but yeah this car is overall suspicious I would say the trunk is not that big but its decent size Zen stands for zero engine noise but trust me the engine noise is maximum and the air and noise from the a pillar and the turnover is and the engine noise is not zero like something I miss in this car is music system and power steering rather than that the car is absolutely perfect for 4 people familythe major problem in this car is you will face in winter there is a starting problem in winter you might have to wait 15 minutes you just do self for 15 minutes after that it will start and I guess inemergency case it will a major concern you will face we have driven this car up to Shimla from nangal like it's almost 300 kilometres or more. But yeah it's almost 20 years I am dealing with the car. What's the most valuable car of that time but yeah if you are looking to buy a new car now a days my suggestion is that you go for the Kia seltos or the creta.
MarutiSuzuki;Zen;30 Sep 2019;Milw Aukee;4.3; Daily Commute ;This has been the perfect City car for me. I owned it between 2006 and 2013 and covered 97K kilometers with one major repair - a Denso alternator which costed me INR 3,700 including replacement labour !!! It was a wonderful value for money car which refused to give up.With a powerful 1.0 litre 4 cylinder engine on a compact light weight body, the car had enough power for the city to be driven arou nd like the psychedelic rickshaw-walla. Had power steering, air conditioning and power windows (front) which were more than sufficient for me. The only qualms were missing ABS. I do not remember whether it had driver airbags, but even with than, it could have never been a safe highway machine. Even while selling, the car did not disappoint me (high re-sale value)!Just love that car so much!!
MarutiSuzuki;Zen;16 Dec 2020;Anand Tom;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;It's an amazing pocket rocket that can pretty much take all the abuse you throw at it.Also maintenance and service can be done by yourself easily.Overall the car is a brilliantly designed car the only complaint i have is the really small boot space.Other than that its and absolute joy to drive both in cities and highway.Also it gives fuel economy on your driving.If you are first time car buyer thi s is a go to vehicle as it can show you the joys of driving a front engine rear wheel drive.Also this car is very easy to tune and can be done at a really low price as well.

MarutiSuzuki;800;6 Aug 2020;Rashtrapal D..;5.0; Family Car ;What are the dimensions of the car? How is the fuel economy? There are also many relevant subjective (opinion-based) details. For instance, how does the car handle? Does it sport a beautiful interior and exterior? Is the steering wheel too big or too small? Use these and other related questions to stay focused when writing your review.Some details which do not directly pertain to the quality of th e car can enhance your writing. The personality of the dealer who provided the car, or the history of the car’s manufacture could be of interest and add personality and depth to your review. Generally, however, you should omit details which are not relevant to the quality of the driving experience.Don’t include your personal itinerary unless using it to indicate that driving on different types of terrain such as dirt roads leads to a new insight about the quality of the vehicle.

MarutiSuzuki;Estilo;15 Sep 2019;Aaditya Khare;2.7; Occasional Commute ;never choose any car with less wheel base it was our first car and not at all suggested to anyone to go for such a car with less wheel base, small tyre size.many times we faced problems because of it. Often it got punctured or engine oil seal got damaged during the travel as objects got struck/hitting the car because of which sometimes we faced sever problem during over journey. Once engine got se ized and car stopped in the road itself as it was not able to cross a bump on the road and oil leakage was there because of which engine got seized.also maruti service was not appropriate.Overall exp. was bad with the car.
MarutiSuzuki;Estilo;30 Sep 2020;Riyazulislam..;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I own a Zen estilo as a secondary car, it has now been driven more than 1,10,000 kilometers and still drives perfectly. It is a nice car for both city, and short trips to my hometown. The car has a little much ground clearance as compared with other hatchbacks, so i don’t have any issues in using on the roads of my rural town. The car is great for rough use as we Indians do and i didn't need to spend much on it too. The 1000cc petrol engine is enough for daily city use and gives a mileage upto 15kmpl.
MarutiSuzuki;Estilo;9 Oct 2019;Gopendra M;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;its an average car for middle class. no problems if maintained well. it lacked many features at that time when i bought in 2008. maruti is good brand and timely serviced cars will remain good. i would suggest to get it serviced little earlier than recommended.

MarutiSuzuki;SX4;31 Oct 2020;Dhayaalan VR;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;Sx4 is the most underrated car of the last decade, Just like this decade fiat cars.It sports a 1586cc, 103.2bhp, Independent suspension, Abs disk breaks, Leather seats, Very high ground clearance and everything at just 7.47 lakhs unlike any other car of that time.It was the most luxurious yet a very affordable car that any middle class man might expect.Even the car of the year 2007 honda civic tho ugh had higher performance ratings didn't meet up with its comfort standards and suspension technology.It was always regarded as a failure model, But in our family it had been with us for 13 years now and its still gold, Except for the mileage which any car with over 200000 km travel would have ended up with.
MarutiSuzuki;SX4;7 Nov 2020;Manav Sharma;4.7; Daily Commute ;Sx4 is great in mileage if you running it in sequential fitted cng.As in comfort this is the best car in its older times.Even today also n performance you will get to know if you can catch me on delhi jaipur highway.Even new variant of verna can't beat the sx4 speed.

MGMotor;ZSEV;20 Sep 2020;Sid Bhatt;5.0; Family Car | Daily Commute ;Once you drive an electric car you will never drive ICE car. MG ZS is a bit expensive but savings of electricity use will catch up. ProsLots of roomThough is compact SUV, it's stance is like an SUV with great visibility and easy to get in and outInterior is very comfortable Boot size is decent 0 - 100 it does in 8 secondsFinishing is goodiSmart AppConsSome features in App is missing compared to Th ai cersionMissing features Auto Pilot, blind spot assist, front sensorsMissing Led Jawad lamp plus missing Led bright light in cabin and boot.Very happy so far. Will write 6 months review soon.Range is no problem for me as I drive max avg 50 Kms a day so with 300 Kms range on full battery charging every 5th day. That's not bad also the feeling of not going to petrol pump is great. ( You know what I mean)Charging at home is simple. Car comes with home charge panel. Wiring is done by co and charging station 7.5 KW is installed free of cost. With higher cost of electricity in Mumbai it costs around Rs.1.2-1.5 per km. That's a lot of savings on my previous petrol car that used to cost close to Rs 8 per km.If you are planning to buy any ICE or EV will definitely insist to test drive MG ZS. You will never drive ICE car after this. With regen level 3, you can literally drive car using only 1 foot for acceleration for 95% of time.

MGMotor;Hector20192021;9 Sep 2019;Setu Dani;1.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I booked MG Hector on 19th of July, 2019. I opted for the Smart DCT option (Aurora Silver) at MG’s Showroom Ahmedabad which is owned by Concept motors. I had driven MG before booking the car itself. But after booking it I still wanted a test drive. So 2 weeks after booking the car i went down for a test drive. I was with the same sales person who sold me the car. I was just cruising around on th e service road when there was a thud noise in the Engine and then the car stopped. I looked on to the information cluster ahead and it showed orange coloured exclamation mark to which the sales person told that there is some issue with the transmission of the car. He called some guy from the technical dept where he told me that transmission had failed and it was the second time something like this happened. The car had only 4200km on the test runs. I cancelled the booking the next day to which their manager told me to wait and let’s see if there was any issue or not. But as I was adamant they proceeded with the refund. Though they told me that the refund will be processed within 15 days, it took them 28 days just to process it and give me the cheque that too after alot of follow ups. The car is good on cosmetics but I don’t think so that you can trust the engine in long run. MG still needs to take care and refine the engine according to indian road conditions. Giving variety of features won’t help if there is an issue in the Engine Quality.
MGMotor;Hector20192021;2 Dec 2020;Santosh Kumar;4.3; Daily Commute ;I have purchased with very much thought of available cars in the segment to choose from i had following options xuv i am short heighted so a big nocreta test drive this car but not comfortable with the space it is not a upgrade from my ritz maruti which is more spacious insidemaruti baleno/ ciaz not want to go same logo ritz to ciaz and hence the only option to go with comfortable and road presenc e is hectorcoming onto modelstyle it has very basic even alloy wheels are not there which i find in this segment of car where we have to go for 15 lakhs spending and finally we will get no alloys!! no acceptedsuper (petrol) a very good model and all basic have been incorporated with alloy wheelsinternet version i didnt want to for as the cost is high and with little tweaks of lights interior, Internet enabled apps.Which are over the requirement.And with super petrol version i drove from delhi to jaipur, 80kmph and 120 kmph warning beeps remind to slow down and drive at ease and comfortablywas able to overtake easily and believe me mg hector has road presence its driving a luxurious car.Spacious was able to dump all the shopping my wife has spend into the rear space still with three luggage inside.Was very nice.
MGMotor;Hector20192021;1 Oct 2020;Rahul M;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Mg Hector plus is a supercar with all the features and Looks, look wise its stunning and sensible and with all the features in this price - no car even Toyota Fortuner is not so close to this - after driving fortune 4x4 and after sitting and driving Hector plus you feel amazed, as it's open and fresh and in Fortuner, it was bit claustrophobic bcoz of all close things. Mg did a fantastic touch, its a UK old and trusted brand and manufacturing unit is in Gujrat - do not go with cheap comments on Chinese parts and others as its bot makes sense. In August their growth and selling are 41% up, so you can see the trend, please do see and check the car and drive you will be amazed its an Audi Q7 in 20-23lakhs with all the features. Also, the company is providing 5years warranty which is super solid no other company is giving this kind of support and services and there is no need to worry!! All other cars are not like MG Hector, you can see the trend in the coming months!!

MGMotor;Hector20192021;23 May 2020;Sonu Monnappa;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Wonderful vehicle . Safety , quality of materials used , comfort and creature comfort is top notch . Space was a necessity as all my family members are tall. Compared to its competition , it felt more roomier and comfortable . The petrol engine is powerful but the DCT is a bit slow to respond . mileage is decent , it returned 8kmpl in city and 12kmpl on highway. The maintenance cost is good , many service packages to choose from . I have the Smart Variant. Overall Value for money vehicle.
MGMotor;Hector20192021;29 Sep 2020;Abraham P;3.3; Tours ;Never Go for Hector,it' poor in Quality. Touch display not responsive ,also Tyre grip not enough, More over being Chinese Owned vehicle low Quality is well reflected. All money you pay for Hector goes to China who is about to attack our boarders and is helping pakisthan with arms & ammunitions to attack india and is already Hacking our countries networks. Now think where to invest your money when you have Quality build Ford ,Creta Toyota & Mahindra and now TATA too.

If we compare the cars in hectors price range Jeep compass is over prized no premium features no comfort. Tata Harrier is fair and interior is worst . The segment king Hyundai Creta is just like I20 wearing heels it is not a car Worth buying. I waited for mg was confused in hector and Creta but hector was just better than creta in terms of design, features, interior . So thos e people planning to buy hector buy the smart model because it worth buying and I have also bought the smart one.

Hyundai;Creta;25 Aug 2020;Rajesh Vohra;4.3; Daily Commute ;I have Purchased New Creta 1.5CRDI SX(O). After Driving about only 500kms my feedback about car is really good. All features are really good EXCEPT TYRES. NEXEN TYRES are of really Inferior quality. I am truly unsatisfied by these tyres. In about driving 300Kms One of the tyres got bursted. I got it replaced from the service center. But Now after driving 200 kms more one of other side TYRE bursted . As a regular Hyundai Customer i did not expect this type of poor quality material from Hyundai.
Hyundai;Creta;16 Aug 2020;Shree dw;2.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Car is good looking and attractive thus purchased the SX manual but getting regret now on. It misses lot of safety and convince features. Engine performance is not enough, lot of down shift and day by day it looks like engine is getting poor. You pay a huge amount onroad for this but you don't get what you deserve, suggest alternative who wanna buy this. Mileage is also an issue everyone facing. T oo away from what Hyundai claims. I tried everything, I am not a rough driver and keeps car within economical limits and good smooth drives but still mileage is hardly 8-9 kmpl. You get bulky SUV but not an luxury and a powerful car. 1.5 ltr petrol engine is not for you if you want smooth comfortable ride.
Hyundai;Creta;26 Dec 2020;Kalyan Pichu..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I purchased Creta SX Diesel Manual before 2 months and had driven 6000 kms. I have driven the car both inside city and in highway. Car has been pretty amazing. Comfort, style and safety has been top notch. My total avg mileage has been around 20.6 kmpl. my top speed in the car is 190 kmph and felt amazing stability and very minimal vibration. Doors and body of the car is very steady and you can fe el it when you drive. Overall it has been an amazing experiance.
Hyundai;Creta;4 Nov 2020;Audi Rexus;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;creta is extraordinary in comfy and performance and also provides decent mileage and i go for it. I bought E variant and totally modified to SX at cost ~2 lakhs with Top end model TRIO HEADLIGHT AND ALLOYS. Sunroof and Original Music system are those two features i missed it! But i suggest you all to buy E Variant and modify. You can make SX model in just 14.5 laks
Hyundai;Creta;8 Jun 2020;Rishi kale;3.0; Daily Commute;On an average I drive around 1500 Kms a month of which 1100 kms is a Express Highway Drive. Despite trying everything like driving at constant speed of 100, maintaining the Tyre pressure, regular service and oil checks there is no improvement in Mileage. It is hardly 9 km /per litre . Company service station also seem to be clueless. Would appreciate suggestions.
Hyundai;Creta;7 Nov 2020;Utkarsh Singh;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;One of the most refined suv in the market it focusses on things that matter. In comparison to seltos and Hector, there's a lot less NVH levels which alleviate the comfort and reduce fatigue over longer distances. The engine is smooth and tractable. And the music system is great too. The car is a true family car.
Hyundai;Creta;5 Jan 2021;Green Blue;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I have base variant,in base variant there is no inbuilt music system and no inside front roof light's three two things want to upgrade for base variant,ride comforts are very good, you will like to continue the drive without talking any rest,it looks awesome, good mileage at diesel and not bad,loveable one.
Hyundai;Creta;11 Dec 2020;Jatin Kalra;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;awesome car for city drive as well as highway drive. Sporty looks and fast car. Best in segment and spacious car.

Hyundai;Creta;20 May 2020;Kaberi De;5.0; Daily Commute;Awesome car. Makes a great and stylish appearance with many more features along with a turbo charged 1.8 litre diesel engine. In the diesel automatic variant the clutch is so smooth. Just go for it without losing1a single minute. 👍👍
Hyundai;Creta;3 Jan 2021;Sumit Mahapatra;4.7; Family Car ;Creta is the best pick in this range of suv, I would suggest go for this suv.More comfort, Great safety.Only thing i don't like is its gps mapping system.Not upto date.Very difficult to update.

Hyundai;Venue;5 Jan 2020;Kunal Choksi;2.0; Daily Commute;Purchased this car in July 2019 i.e. the DCT automatic 1.0 turbo petrol S model Review after 6 month use A. Hyundai india and modi hyundai never informed the consumers that DCT will overheat in bumper to bumper taffic during the pre sales and sales cycle B. Overheating is mentioned in the car owner manual which during sales cycle no one shows to the potential customer C. If you reverse and drive t he car a couple of times during parking the temp will go up D. The car overheats in bumper to bumper traffic and you will have to stop the carE. If you have to drive, then you will keep switching between neutral and drive mode whenever you stop this defeating the purpose of buying an automatic F. Lost complete faith and kick my self in buying a hyundai car DO NOT BUY THE HYUNDAI VENUE DCT VERSION IF YOU HAVE TRAFFIC IN YOUR AREA
Hyundai;Venue;22 Sep 2020;Anurag Gupta;5.0; Daily Commute ;Value for money with excellent performance. Highway mileage is very negotiable, you can extract 18-20 kmpl on highways at speed of 80-100 kmph in 6th gear.Even while throttling it hard at 140 kmph you get mileage of about 14-15 kmpl.City mileage depends on traffic conditions and getting 13-15 kmpl is not a big deal.Drivability is another plus factor with this car, it gives you a good driving exper ience. (I have driven it for about 5400 km in just 2 months which includes 2 trips from Aligarh to Sonbhadra in UP)P.S - highway mileage calculated thrice on 320 km long Lko-Agra expressway, also regularly cross checked on NH 34 from Aligarh to Khurja.
Hyundai;Venue;21 Aug 2020;Anoop Damodaran;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;zigwheels brought me the first intimation of venue s+ variant launched..otherwise i was planned to purchase the s variant of venue and booked the vehicle on July 8 2020, decided to make fitments aftermarket, zigwheels in time notified the introduction of venue s+ variant in which all the equipments came factory fitted on a low price of after market and in which automatic head lamps, height adjusta ble seats, drvm etc is not possible in aftermarket. thank you cardekho team for such a timely response loved it
Hyundai;Venue;30 Oct 2019;Ravi Shanker;2.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;The car is amazing in all aspect except one that its DCT transmission has got overheating issues when driven in extreme traffic conditions.Secondly there is no proper customer care support as they say that driving the car in extreme traffic conditions is considered as harsh driving and one must avoid it.I wonder how Hyundai can be so casual in addressing the customers concern.My advice would be st ay away from DCT as this does not seem to be made for Indian traffic conditions
Hyundai;Venue;28 Jun 2020;Kohli Sahej;4.3; Daily Commute;I have been using the turbo petrol manual sx variant for my daily commute. It is a car that’ll give you a fun to drive experience.It reaches 120km/h in its 3rd gear and acceleration is brisk ( 0-100 in somewhere around 10.5 seconds ).Suspension set up of this car could have been better. And the rear profile of the car could have been better. It gives me a mileage of around 15-16 kmpl.This includ es occasional heavy acceleration.
Hyundai;Venue;13 Sep 2020;Bilal Ali;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Overall a good car in the package keeping the budget in mind. Hyundai has always been at the core front of delivering a quality driving experience & loaded features. The Turbo petrol is really fun to drive, if you are a small family then go for it without a toss. The suspension area is something which the car makers have to seriously work in, it's pathetic. Overall a good budget car!
Hyundai;Venue;20 Aug 2020;Kamal Agarwal;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Shock absorbers are not upto the mark, one side rear tyres lift up while turning and driving hill simultaneously at a time. Very very very sensible vehicle in terms of mileage, mileage is good if you constantly running and changing gears smoothly, but if you are abit rough in changing gears or using clutch than mileage drops suddenly, i have personally tested and calibrated.
Hyundai;Venue;29 Sep 2020;Vimal Singh;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Its the pleasure to drive city ride with optimum space and comfort and yet the supportive power. The b st part of this car is its 1. Crome grill and 2. The steering wheel. The electric steeering wheel is the key game changer for both of the sister concern car manufacturers be it KIA MOTORS or HYUNDAI MOTORS. Its amazing!
Hyundai;Venue;14 Sep 2020;Bhargav Reddy;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;mileage is horrible for me. For petrol version i am getting around 11-12 kmpl .and comfort if the road is good then there is no problem but if there are any p*t holes then people sitting back will experience hell. All remaining are fine and up ti the mark. Think and look for multiple options before choosing.
Hyundai;Venue;5 Sep 2020;Mhon Ngullie;3.3; Daily Commute ;Poor suspension quality. Driven only 6500 km. Got replaced front & rear shock absorber, steering rack, rear coil spring. Steering column going to be replaced. Still suspension noise is there. Driving comfort is zero in bad road condition. Very disappointed becoz of suspension problems.
Hyundai;Venue;14 Sep 2020;Amit Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;This is the car i was much awaiting for and i have driven this car for 4000km and it is so smooth tough and makes you feel safe at high speed and also it has great control. Styling and all is standard in this variant it only lacks in the sitting comfort a bit but that can be managed.
Hyundai;Venue;24 Oct 2020;Rajesh Ayyappan;5.0; Family Car ;It's a very good car for a small family with a max of 4 members and showing much comfort while driving. Though it's 1-liter turbo sometimes I felt the pickup is somewhat needed more. Maybe because while comparing with 1.5 liters which prior to that I used to drive.
Hyundai;Venue;1 Sep 2019;Updates Global;1.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Don't buy this car. At lease don't prefer the turbo engine.
Hyundai;Venue;18 Mar 2020;Mohammed Faris;3.7; Family Car ;This is best one but mileage is very low. features,styling ,comfort ,safety and performing is very high . I like suv cars Best car I've ever seen.The smallest car is the XVV segment that can be taken very quickly on any small road
Hyundai;Venue;22 Jan 2021;Shivam Dhiman;4.0; Daily Commute ;Superb performance with simple and cool interior design.External design is awesome.I love the cornering lights.However the gear changing is bit jerky and also travel is much if compared to maruti cars.But overall the car is good.
Hyundai;Venue;7 Mar 2020;Rachita Pati;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;I think the designer should focus on interior design of the car as well . The interiors are very basic and doesn't give a luxurious feel at all. overall performance of the car and exterior is great .Very smooth drive .
Hyundai;Venue;25 Jan 2021;Prabsimran Lota;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;It's a butter smooth driving car they should do something about the suspension it stated making a lot of noise while it's going on rough road. But has a smooth ride and it drives like a butter.
Hyundai;Venue;12 Mar 2020;Siddhartha Das;3.7; Daily Commute ;I bought 1.2 s model petrol.. could not manage 1.4 Diesel s model as out of stock bs4_6 issues,it's Abit underpowered in lower gears. Shaking is so so .. other facilities are good enough.
Hyundai;Venue;4 Sep 2020;Aman Rastogi;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;One of the best compact SUV in the market, which doesn't miss out on any feature you need.Though upcoming cars (Sonet) has a bit edge over venue, still venue is just at Sonet's tail.
Hyundai;Venue;18 Aug 2020;Mohit Sharma;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Poor matrial used for decreasing cost.Two times tyre have burst.15 inches spare wheel.front glass broke just with a small stone who flew from front vechile.less leg space in rear seat
Hyundai;Venue;6 Dec 2020;Vinay S;3.7; Family Car ;Nice car but some safety features are missing which i get if i buy ford ecosport.But i likr mileage of this car if i drive normally means under 90 them i definitely get 24 25 mileage.

Hyundai;Venue;31 Jul 2020;Dayanand Gan..;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Good car for the budget, could have been better with little more safety features like hill assist control and traction control, as in Nexon base variant.

Hyundai;Grandi10;9 Mar 2020;Harish CHALL..;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;a perfect car for a family of 4. worth every single penny. best car in this segment. I frequently travel long distances (700kms) at a stretch, never felt troubled. goes very smooth upto 130-140km. from 140, vehicle starts slightly trembling. but in our roads, we rarely go for that speed continuously. a reasonable mileage of 15-18 Kms(petrol variant). a great look. don't ever ask about the interior s, Hyundai is always the best in this. good controls, great boot space and leg space. this is the only car in this segment which gives a rear AC vent. engine is very smooth. car is very safe. only minor problem is: the bottom portion is made of plastic, if the car goes over some oddly constructed speed breakers or deep pits there are high chances that the bottom carrier assembly getting broken. it happened twice for me in the first year of purchase itself. then I understood that I need to go slower than the slowest over such places and then never faced any problem.apart from that, I have no single complaint. go for minimum sports version, to enjoy a wholesome ride.
Hyundai;Grandi10;28 Oct 2020;Pramit Roy;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I bought this car in December 2018. And I have been using this car for the last 2 years and I'm happy with the car till now. Overall performance is good, I drove the car on tarmac, Hill station, Bad roads filled with potholes and I'm impressed with the ride quality of this car. The only con/disadvantage of this car is its ground clearance (approach angle specifically). The ground clearance is quit e low and not ideal for Indian road conditions. Rest it's a perfect family car with good performance and decent mileage. An initial lag is there but post-2000 rpm performs quite well till 5000 RPM. The comfort that the car provides is best in its segment I feel. Overall I'm happy with the car. It's a comfortable feature-rich family car with good performance and driving dynamics.
Hyundai;Grandi10;2 Sep 2020;Kumar Doka;4.0; Family Car ;Nice car but this may up more, in my entire drive I enjoying a lot n good news is that still I didn't allow to touch the engine part because it's one handed owner. Good car in my opinion. M happy to be a customer for Hyundai but unfortunately to say that now m going to be a KIA's customer for kia sonet or may be for mahindra company for new n exciting most awaited suv in India. But first preferenc e shall be goes on KIA's sonet because lots of tremendously loaded with features but before buying I would like to confirm KIA's sonet ground clearance, if it is more than 190 mm of ground clearance then definitely go for the KIA's sonet🤩 because in my state maximum of roads are hilly as well tough roads too.
Hyundai;Grandi10;20 Sep 2019;Jonathan Emmett;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Own 2014 Asta Petrol. Gives me 18kmpl in the city and on long highway drives goes upto 24kmpl. For a family of 3. A good comfortable car with enough space for luggage. Driving is easy in the city with the dimensions. Parking and turning in tight spaces is a breeze. Engine response is good enough and gives you the small boost needed for fast overtakes. Seems confident enough on the highways at fast speeds but I don"t push it more than the 100km mark. Hyundai"s design language is one of my favorites before Honda"s. And the Asta version is feature packed.

Hyundai;Grandi10;14 Oct 2019;Thang Seldou;3.7; Family Car ;First of all, it is a stylish hatchback that beats the hell out of Maruti Swift and others. Interior is tip top, materials used are superior to other cars in this price segment. Smooth and problem free driving, no major maintenance needed in 5 years. Mileage is not the best in its segment, but it is ok. Overall, it surpasses others in style and comfort. But due to the low ground clearance, the fro nt bumper very often scrapes the ground in bad roads. So have to be careful while driving over potholes.
Hyundai;Grandi10;19 Feb 2020;Sooraj S;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;this is my father's car so I also drive it my experience with this car is fantastic driving .we had gone for a long trip still it makes our face even more happy .The performance of the car is mindblowingly phenomenal it's suspension is apt for our Indian roads but it's stearing has no feel and feedback . it's automatic transmission is a 5 speed torque converter & it gives sudden response

No issue with its fit & finish, interior,music system, pricing etc.I suggest new buyer to go for Ford/Honda.
Hyundai;Grandi10;6 Jul 2020;Suman Roy;5.0; Occasional Commute ;It is a good hatchback which has the basic requirements all in place such as seatbelt alert, all four power windows and good torque. Now that diesel price is almost equal with Petrol, I do not have any qualms on why I did not get a Diesel variety. The after sales experience was not upto the mark but that does not count towards the manufacturer :)
Hyundai;Grandi10;24 Sep 2020;Laxmikant Pa..;4.3; Daily Commute ;it was a very good car and nice mileage as hyundai has offer comfortable ride. but has some problems with the car that is its front fenter is very frazile and bad quality plus its engine cabinet made with plastic so it may be breaking on every hard bump car make.....as a diesel car it has 18Kmpl mileage in city and 22 Kmpl mileage in highway.
Hyundai;Grandi10;17 Mar 2020;Abdias Michael;4.3; Daily Commute ;It's a wonderful hatchback and I would go on to say it's the best in its segment! The features it offers are amazing and the best thing I like about the car is that it is so silent. Hyundai has done really well in keeping engine noise outside the cabin. I feel it's a little underpowered for a 1.2 l engine, rest everything is superb!!

Hyundai;Grandi10;13 Jan 2019;Sanjeev Shir..;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It gives me a mileage of 17 in 75% city and 25% semi highway condition and 21.5 kmpl in 90% Highway condition.The Car is very good as far as reliability is concerned. I was owning Santro Xing GLS since 2009 also earlier, the same trust continues in Grand i10 Sports which i bought in 2015 also. You Start the vehicle and go wherever is your destination, it will take you and bring you back without an y breakdown. That is assured. Frequent minor breakdown is also not there in the Vehicle. But No Airbags. As for me Safety First of my Family.Accident Happens only Once and forever.So safety first.

Hyundai;Grandi10;12 Jul 2020;Ankit Shah;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours ;I drive approx 300-400 kms a week.

I get an average of 17-17.5 kmpl of complete highway drive & 15-15.5 kmpl for city + highway drive.
Hyundai;Grandi10;20 Feb 2019;Aman Yadav;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I am having the 2016 sportz crdi variant of this. Its overall a nice package. For short highway trips with 4 people in the car. For the daily commute its the best one as it has the LIGHTEST steering wheel among all the cars i"ve driven making it easy for me when i have to reach office in the busy city like noida. Also ive taken this through highways many times, most of the time it was allahabad wh ich is around 700kms from my home its not good to drive over 100 as steering is too light, but its not that problematic. Also it returns a nice milage of 21 kmpl on highways and 17kmpl in city.
Hyundai;Grandi10;13 Aug 2020;Riju Das;4.3; Daily Commute ;Hyundai grand i 10 is a very good car but service centres are lagging behind compared to Maruti. maintenance cost is higher than that of maruti cars of the same price range and mileage is poor. But it was the most stylish car of this hatchbach segment and most comfortable too.
Hyundai;Grandi10;14 Jan 2019;Subhasish Bala;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Done about 11k kms in just more than an year, have taken it to 2500+kms road trip. Fully satisfied with the car. Does come with cooled glovebox which is a boon for road trips which the swift or other maruti and ford misses on. Apt power on Highway for overtaking but a slight less for dominating overtakes. Overall great experience. Miss the lack of centre armrest and an auto dimming electrochromic irvm and the wheels are a tad too small. Also 5th gearing should be kept longer. 100kmph at 2900rpm almost
Hyundai;Grandi10;18 Jan 2019;Hormazd Irani;4.3; Tours ;Since I love the mountains, I wanted a car which could pull comfortably and hence I opted for the diesel version also known as CRDI (common rail diesel injection). I have since been using this car for family outings mostly out of town. This is where you can see that the diesel shines. It feels effortless to drive and returns excellent mileage. I could not have asked for more. It is well built and is a reliable performer. It takes up less space when parking and hence is good for use in city too.

Hyundai;Verna;24 Dec 2020;Prasob Prabh..;4.3; Family Car ;I bought verna top spec petrol sxo ivt, I have crossed 5000 km and here are my experience pros - 1.Smooth ride, No cabin noise 2.Loaded with all fearures for the segment, Probably better than its rival.3.Comfort of seats 4.Ventilated front seats is really a boon trust me, I use it always 5.Powerful ac 6.Premium exterior looks, I got phantom black and beleave me people really do appreciate the car and its looks.7.Shiny diamond cut alloy wheels for this spec really looks dashing, This alloy looks better than city and other rivals 8.Power, Engine never loses steam and gives you good power and ride stability along all speeds.Its an cvt gearbox still power generation is superb.Mileage - i get 18 to 20 on highways without ac, In city traffic its between 12 to 14, So average for a trip is 15 to 16.Cons - though none but few aspects which may not be the best are 1.Rear space - now it has same wheel base like its rival city and other sedans so practically it has same space inside car, But real legroom looks slight less but i did a test drive with my family and im 5.6 so we all were very comfortable, Seat base and height is bigger, So its qute relaxing for us at rear but for huge passengers better testdrive.2.Not a negative point but some features arent much of a use like wireless charger, Not many mobile in india has this facility and the charger is small, Mobiles more than 6 inch wont fit in.3.Hyundai should have given more to verna, Like hyundai is pampering its lower segment car like i20 and venue with very great feature which verna dosent has like air purifier, Ambient lighting, 10.2 inch touchsceen etc.These features would have surely made it a tough rival for city.4.Price - top spec petrol in 16.6 lakhs onroad in my town, Where as top spec city petrol is 17 lakh, So not much of a difference, Should have been atleast a lakh less.
Hyundai;Verna;26 Oct 2020;Prince vibek;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;1. Refined engine, very silent cabin.2. Pleasant, soft and relaxed driving experience.3. Smooth gearbox.4. Easy to park, thanks to rear camera with guidelines.5. Looks much better in real life than in photos!6. Feature loaded.7. Comfortable for both the driver and the passengers.8. Premium feel.9. Looks best in black but hard to maintain, so bought silver.Any disadvantages? Not really. For those c omplaining about rear seat space, for a height of 5,7 the seats are good. In fact I can use the word great for its comfort and premium feel. And for those complaining about performance, this car has more than enough power for the daily driver. SX variant is value for money, it really stands out among all rivals too. ( Priced below base variant of Honda City). It offers almost all features one wants in a car like electric sunroof, rear camera, electric folding mirrors, led DRL, projector headlamps and fog lamps, cornering lamps, 16 inch alloy wheels, rear AC, touchscreen infotainment, 4 speakers + 2 tweeters plus some cool features like digital instrument cluster (looks very modern), wireless charger (it is actually more useful than you think), smart trunk (hands free boot), push button start (with smart key), rear curtain (premium feel), cooled glove box, sliding armrest, auto headlamps, auto IRVM, etc. The list goes on!Some of these features are not offered in other cars while some others are offered only on higher and costly variants. Hyundai superb quality and wide service network is a bonus. For 12 lacs on road price, the petrol 1.5 manual SX variant is a very sweet deal.
Hyundai;Verna;17 Apr 2020;Pearlson Kart;5.0; Daily Commute ;My daily drive. Offers a mileage around 10-11KMPL in Chennai traffic. Being top end and due ventilated seats keep things in hot and heavy traffic situations. Sunroof have used in ECR night drives. Android auto connectivity for all mobile phones is poor. It disconnects automatically after few seconds or minutes. Car is fully loaded with features. With that comfort is on par with the class competiti on.Would have liked the brakes feel better or a rear wheel disc, still good for city and highways.Had issues with a rattling sound in the steering column when roads are uneven. The entire steering column was replaced in warranty. That saved huge bucks.
Hyundai;Verna;2 Oct 2020;Linu Ninan;3.7; Daily Commute ;Thrilling Power performance. Overall experience is good. I have never been in any trouble. I have drive upto 600 km at a stretch. Good handelling and much better ride quality compared to fluidic Verna. Long distance it gave me 22kmpl. I could take it to 170 kmph at highways. Service provider are hopeless. Every time they need to change parts. I don't know why a company maintained vehicle need that much replacement even after taking so much of care. Service cost is high
Hyundai;Verna;7 Jun 2020;Ankit Jaiswal;4.3; Family Car;This car is better than it's own segment.in the car front view and rear view very very attractive.this car have a long leg space for back side passengers so that we are feel comfortable. For long ride we can't tired with this car. It's desiel version is better than petrol. Hyundai Verna's mileage is good that you need. So it all reasons it makes a family car.
Hyundai;Verna;24 Jun 2020;Reo D;4.7; Family Car ;i have hyundai verna sx(o),it has a very good performance in its segment,and the features are awosome like smart trunk,smart key,wireless charging pad,ventilated seats,android auto and blue link feature ,electric sunroof,auto door lock and unlock,electro chronīc mirror,automatic climate control.the look far better then its rivals.

Hyundai;Aura;18 Jul 2020;Shankar Venk..;4.7; Daily Commute ;Awesome Sporty looking Mini Sedan. Decent cabin space for 4 passengers. Smooth to drive. Very good mileage even in city conditions. Enough boot space. Pickup good enough for a smooth city drive, don't expect that extra turbo pickup which maybe their turbo model has. Front looks very appealing. Rear could have been better. The black C panel adds beauty to its rear thus masking the rear flaws. Overa ll very satisfied with the car
Hyundai;Aura;15 Mar 2020;DaRK RiDeR;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Best looking car, more features in less price like wireless charging, mileage approx:- 21-22kmpl, Boot space is good, trunk of that car is very impressive because of big space, new colour options, stylish alloy and sports like interior, but you will not get wireless charging in last all 4th models but in top model and second model will get wireless charging.
Hyundai;Aura;14 Aug 2020;Mitesh Vasava;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;good mileage, comfort and. premium interior good car in handling good thing is this car comes in 3 engine option 1 lit turbo for fun to drive, 1.2 diesel for more torque and mileage, 1.2 petrol for smoother driving and 1.2 petrol CNG is for daily routine people i love this car by premium look and interior in this subcompact sedan segment.

Hyundai;Santro;29 Sep 2020;Aakarsh Roshan;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I bought the new Hyundai Santro Sportz AMT (Anniversary Edition) in December 2019. The anniversary edition was a great choice as it had reverse parking sensors, dual airbags and reverse parking camera as well which the normal Sportz variant didn't have at that time. Also in the exterior there are black roof rails, black door handles, black ORVM'S and greyish black wheel covers. The car has excelle d in evey aspect except some. Now I would highlight some aspects and my verdict about them for this car. SAFETY- 3.5/5 as it has received a two-star NCAP rating. Still when you shut the doors you will feel that this car's build quality is good. Also you get dual airbags in Sportz AMT and Asta variants.COMFORT- 4/5 This is one of the main strong points of this car. You get many features for your comfort and convenience like Rear AC vents, Steering mounted audio and phone controls, 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple Car Play, 4 speakers etc. Some features for easy driving like Rear parking Camera, Reverse Parking Sensors, Good Visibility, Rear defogger etc. The reason I gave 4/5 in comfort is because it lacks adjustable headrests in both rows, no height adjustable driver seat, no tilt steering.PERFORMANCE- 4.5/5 It is a great city car especially due to its AMT transmission option. However, driving enthusiasts would not be a big fan of this 1.1l 68 bhp, 99nm engine. You will not get that exta punch but the engine is just perfect for this car. The engine is very refined there is almost no engine noise or road noise as it is a 4 cylinder engine. The NVH levels are very low which is again a good point about this car.EXTERIOR- 4/5 Well it is definitely a good looking car but it somehow reminds us of the Grand i10 or Eon. No doubt it has some different looks than the i10 or Eon. But it has its own charm which is also a great point about this car.MILEAGE- 4.5/5 I live in Jammu where there isn't much traffic like in Delhi or Mumbai. I get a mileage between 13 kmpl and 14.5 kmpl in city. In highways it ranges between 15.5 kmpl and 17 kmpl.OVERALL VERDICTThe santro has retained its 22 years old legacy in India with this new generation santro. It definitely gets a spot in top 3 cars in the segment. It promises a comfortable ride for a family of four or even of five up to an extent with decent enough legroom and headroom and that rear ac vents which add up to the comfort of the car. It definitely has to gear up a thing or two like driver's comfort and pricing. But still it is a good enough package for anyone with a budget of less than 7.5 lakhs (on road price) and the santro has really impressed me too.
Hyundai;Santro;23 Aug 2020;Chinky Arun;5.0; Family Car | Tours;my evergreen CAr forever even I have Vw polo... it's amazing performance look and speed and disappointed about mileage... same as polo I have groom space and dashboard clearance views.. easier to drive in cities and traffic.. I have used car for 7 years.. I have did only 3 service.. for 47,000kms ... Even its seconds Santro I purchased it runs like two wheeler anywhere in cities.. I have driven ka rnataka tamilnadu states in my car.. tirupati.. very less Maintainence.. no sensor problems.. but polo I faced many problems once water s done for polo car entire sensors will stop working for changing senor it' costing very high price.. polo users are one who handle their car safely. you can see many polo cars on roads which doesn't have any scratches on cars and they are only one who gives the car on periodic services and service records can be seen on car instrument cluster shows entire things.. Cruz'e control available on polo automatic climate control changes electric mirror steering adjust seat height adjust arm rest cool cabin and good leg grooms and stylish look Aero dynamics are good for performance and stylish.. if sensors are maintained good without falling in water it can be good enough for maintainence... ground clearance s less but use the cars in towns and cities.. village users don't choose the cars.. use traffic less route and junk roads it may hit under chase.. use good roads to improve suspension... gear shifting and steering are quite good n good pickup.. mileage is about 14.7 1200 petrol engine.. better than Swift cars.. polo takes race swift cars easier ... swift is not used by professional business mans.. users don't buy swift cars it's all taxi drivers and travelers using cars.. Indica swift are not so surprised cars for own board users.. many yellow board cars are Swift cars.. so everyone hates swifts Every 6000-7000kms need to service.. spare parts are low strength on Maruti Suzuki.. body quality of swift is very very poor... bolts and nuts fateners are like local parts... see the bolt nuts fasteners in polo car it's heavy and design of nuts and bolts locks becoz it have holding s***p and threading holes... but holding strips for polo are good tightened it cant remove easily by spanners.. it need pneumatic gun to remove the screws in vw polo..
Hyundai;Santro;10 Jan 2021;Vishal Sharma;2.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Getting a car in india is always special.In my case, I wanted to buy a beautiful new car for my parents.Spending hours of research, I finally closed santro sportz over tiago and celerio.My folks were extremely happy even though they were pushing me to get a second hand car only :) lets begin the customer experience from sales to after sales: i reached home after first free service.While reversing the car, I felt the clutch fell down or broke.I couldn't move the car and had to call the road side assitance (amazing service).But, Not a great feeling to send your new car by tow-truck in front of your neighbors.4 points bad customer service:1) they forced me to accept that i drive with clutch pressed.2) car was kept in service center for 3 weeks saying the crank shaft is broken and the part will come from korea.3) a welding was proposed on broken the crankshaft on a brand new car4) no temporary vehicle was offered to me even after escalating the issue to higher authorities as well.Finally, When i told them that keep the car and pay me daily compensation, They sent the car very next day.One year after above episode, Front glass has a crack.Service center says it can easily happen in winters:(overall i think it's a good looking, Feature packed car with driving comfort but pretty bad on quality and mileage.
Hyundai;Santro;18 Feb 2020;AKMDD Ken;3.0; Daily Commute;Prices of the BS6 Santro Hatchback would range from around 4.7 lakhs for the basic-spec model and 6.25 lakhs for top-spec variants. So this amounts to a price hike of about 22,000 to 27,000 depending upon the variant. Also, the Era Executive, Sportz, and Sportz AMT now are at a premium of Rs. 28000. However, the CNG variants remain unchanged. The new version will be powered by a 1.1 liter BS6 comp liant Engine that produces the same output of about 69 bhp and 99nm torque.k The other features and safety kit will remain the same apart from transmission 5-speed manual Gearbox and an AMT unit. Features such as rear parking sensors, reverse camera, dual front airbags, and rear wiper/washer, a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with the latest smartphone connectivity, front and rear speakers will be reserved for the top-end
Hyundai;Santro;2 Aug 2020;Alok Ray;3.0; Family Car ;पुरानी सेंट्रो एक मजबूत इंजन वाली पतली , छोटी और लंबे लोगों के लिए बैठने में सुविधाजनक ऊँची गाड़ी , जिसको किसी भी भीड़-भाड़ वाले इलाके में बिना ड्राइवर के सेल� ��फ-ड्राइव करके ले जाया जा सकता है । नई सेंट्रो अधिक चौड़ी और अपेक्षाकृत कमजोर गाड़ी है ।
Hyundai;Santro;11 Jul 2019;Hemendra Soni;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;I own a santro 1.1MT Era 2019 model. i decided not to go for a higher variant and customize the lower variant as per my needs. also i had a tight budget. I installed a sony touch screen system with reverse parking and apple car play compatibility. Also i installed fog lamps of the santro sports varient. as of now..i have clocked 10000+ kms in three months only. the car has a decent performance on highway and city as well on highway i have done a maximum of 133km/h approx. with minimal breaking and lesser clutch use and constant speeds...this is giving me a fuel efficiency of approx 24.5kmpl.. wich is more than expected. though this car is not as quick compared to its rivals such as celerio or swift... it is a very comfortable car and have an exellent amount of leg space of rear and front passenger as well...only thing i did not like about the car is the lack of power in lower gears. being a 4 cylinder car i expected more power at lower rpm"s. overall i am very happy with it.
Hyundai;Santro;8 Oct 2020;Sales;4.3; Family Car ;New launched santro is a good car. Average is also fine I bought this car in aug 2019, after year or so the doors are making a sound like as we are opening or closing a truck door. Horn also got dead but problem was sold when I took it to service center without paying a single ruppee. All in all car is good but I think Hyundai has compromised with quality.
Hyundai;Santro;29 Sep 2019;Lalram Ngheta;4.3; Occasional Commute | Tours ;My first Santro Xing arrived on 17.0212, my wedding day.

Hyundai;Elantra;9 Aug 2020;Raj Upadhyay;4.7; Occasional Commute ;Very stylish looking car! It has a futuristic design and looks styled for the future. It has multiple features, however it has low clearance which is a concern. The other issue is low mileage in city conditions, however, on highways, it gives 17 Km/L.

Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;10 Aug 2020;PRAFFUL V;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I have used it for almost a month now and it has been a satisfactory purchase. Rear seats are inclined and some people especially elderly ladies might not feel comfortable(it might be only my mom too), but ride quality is great. super highway performance. in lower gears you can feel gear switch. as the car crossed 3rd gear then you will hardly feel any gear shifts. i am a novice driver and i am co mfortable in riding. its my first car, so i cant compare with any other one's. no complaints from now with respect to build quality as its Hyundai its amazing.internals feel great, hassle free ride in bangalore. and believe me when i say, Sill board is one such junction which is nightmare for any driver, but in heavy traffic too, i hardly felt any problems, considering i only need to apply break occasionally.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;16 Nov 2019;Vamsee Mohan;4.0; Occasional Commute ;I bought my NIOS in september already drive 2500+km max in highway. Its engine smoothness and sound quality is better than normal grand i10. I like dash board design. Its being ready BS VI its claimes almost 19 to 20kmpl on highway. In city its approx 15. I am forget to share my car model. Its Asta petrol. Feeling comfort and also feeling comfort in driving on long drives.Cons:-1. I am feeling a b it of lag while climbing hills like i went to Tirumala, Tirupathi2. Default Navigation is not provided by Hyundai we use them only with Android auto or Apple. If we have basic mobile its impossible of Navigation.3. Expensive. Its approx ORP is 8.7L.My overall rating is 3.5/5
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;5 Jul 2020;Dushyant Sri..;4.7; Family Car ;At this price point, Hyundai is offering a lot. Seat comfort, upmarket cabin, space in cabin, decent boot space. Comparing this car with swift(Just because 99% of Indian's know swift pretty well) Cabin looks more premium, Plastic quality is way better than swift and most importantly the build quality is better than swift but don't forget swift wins the battle in Average fuel consumption.In my opin ion fixed headrest is a downside of this car, which was not a deal break for me else everything is great.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;21 Jun 2020;Rajesh Reang;4.3; Occasional Commute;its my first time car..i used most of the time in rural road 90% hilly area ... in hilly area with 2nd gear is the best things to climb no matter how high it is... those who said getting lag may b those using 4 or 5th gear in uphill those are nonsense ..there is no lag unless you used ac .. highway also good and drive like 65 to 70kmph again those who said powerless on highway are those nonsense s quid whio wana drive at 200kmph speed then go get Lamborghini..
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;14 Dec 2020;Gaurav Taneja;1.0; Daily Commute ;Same problem with me.I bought in september end.October chali and november se problem aa rahi hai.I have to drive at least more than 6-8 km on petrol otherwise, Car switch off on cng.Earlier vibrations on cng mode were also coming.Service center people don't know what to do.They ask to wait for software update but to no avail.Can i return and get my money back? if possible please help me.First car, Very much depressed because of this issue.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;1 Jul 2020;Deepak Mohan;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;As a owner, I felt it was a best choice buying brand new Hyundai i10 grand nios because it has more leg room at the rear passenger seat, good looking interior, it as more features than the other cars in this segment, engine is quiet refined and smooth. It has exciting features like wireless charging first in the segment, rear AC vents and many more. It is also the best city car and stable in highw ays.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;5 Feb 2020;Santosh Kumar;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Considering the features it's worth every penny spent, however after driving it for 6000 KMs, i can see some boot noise peeping through the cabin. However the MVH levels are well contained. May be because of the pathetic traffic I am not able churn our the best mileage. I am getting around 13 in the Hyderabad traffic.I don't regret considering this on Tiago.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;25 Oct 2020;Deepak Sethi;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Except rear seat, rest of car is really good. I like its performance. The only issue is that rear seat is not much comfortable. Person seating on rear seat feels bumping even on smooth road. One star cut for that. Both front seats are very comfortable. Pickup is very good. Automatic climate control works well. Infotainment consol is user friendly.

Hyundai;Creta20152020;6 Apr 2019;Rajiv Ranjan;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I have purchased Creta Petrol Executive in Mar-19. When you will go through the creta catalog, you will see a lot of attractive features,but will you get those features ..no absolutely not. Hyundai has launched many variant of creta...each have some stand apart features but no version have got all those features. I have purchased petrol top model but it misses on many features such as, Cons of thi s top model: 1. No voice command- You cannot call anyone through voice command. You need to stop your vehicle to call someone from your contact list. You can only call recent dialed number through pressing a botton on steering twice . This is a big feature miss. No Hyundai have this features which is a common in s cross, Ford eco etc.2. No Auto link- Creta catalog have a dedicated page for auto link which will help monitor your vehicle health and driving pattern. But this is limited to Dual tone varient only. Creta Executive doesn"t have this feature. A big miss again.3. No child seat anchor points: This model doesn"t have this. Only automatic transmission features child seat mount. Again a big miss for creat ex.4. No 60:40 split seat: If your child wants to play inside car then this one is a great features. Even in case of three person and big luggage this feature helps. This is missing in Creta Executive.5. No Remote boot opener- it is not there though featured in it"s catalog.6. No voice recognition for GPS : A big miss again. You need connect to Android auto for voice recognition . This doesn"t work. System will always tell you " I couldn"t understand but I can learn". Disappointing.7. Low powered petrol version: don"t go by engine size . 1.6 litre petrol is fuel hungry but powerless specially when you climb an incline.8. No light in vanity mirror: My wife always tells me why it is not there when other low budget cars have this.9. No Auto retract rear view mirror: Rear view mirror doesn"t get retracted upon locking the vehicle this makes the ORVM damage prone. This feature is prevent in other cars like i20.10. Useless Mirror link: This is a feature for making Creta catalog attractive but this is useless. This comes on outdated phones which no one carry. Upon insisting, Hyundai sent a outdated phone model of 2017 which supports mirror link.11. No Tyre pressure monitoring system: This is a good safety feature specially for them who fail to recognize if their Tyre has low or no air. This can prevent a lot of accident upon Tyre air leak. Missing features in Creta.12. No 4 wheel drive: Though this is also not common in other cars.13. Hill hold not of any use: This feature is not of any use as I have experienced. I often run in hilly roads.It gives around 1 second hold when you leave brake at incline to press accelerator but I couldn"t able to use it.14. Need foot step to go inside car: For children and short height family members specially ladies. Foot step need to be fitted by dealer at extra cost and it is prone to get rubbed in walls due to projected portion. 15. Hard dashboard: it doesn"t have soft touch dashboard.Pros of this model:1. Sunroof : Entertaining for children if there is any among your family. 2. Ventilated seat: It can give a little bit of comfort during your long drive. Comes at a price of your home AC. 3. Rear View camera: Helps you park confidently.4. Premium leather seat: Looks and feel premium.5. Six air bags: It is fitted with.6. ESP: It has Electron stability program which might be working during sudden steer but not experienced so far.7. Good sound system: It features an arkamys sound system enabling you localized sound inside cabin.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;23 Nov 2019;Umesh Shejao;4.3; Daily Commute ;Hyundai Creta sx Auto The name it self's convey the msg that you r in premium segment car.I own my first new car in d year 2016 Oct .But before that let me tell you that I had own maruti zen then maruti wagonr and after words. Chevrolet captivata all are very good and family Car .But when I purchase My Beast Creta Must tell you that it's one of the finest model from Hyundai Family. It's give you a pleasure of Richness, comfort of driving SUV , family car, and must say a premium high profile car segment.I usually drive car 90 %in city driving and that too in Mumbai heavy traffic from Borivali to Andheri All 365 days full jam.But thank God I bought CRTEA and that too automatic.Otherwise it's horrible experience of driving manuals car in full traffic jam.Well talking about Milage I would say in city driving the Beast is giving me 15/16 kmpl And on highway I will be 20 /22 And that too non stop driving.AC cooling is superb in 5 min entire cabin is cool.One thing I would like to share with every one that the maintenance cost is too high.Seriously guys whenever I send my car for servicing the minimum bill amount is 18000 And not below that.I mean it seriously.I have all bill from hyundai sai service center. I don't understand why Hyundai is not taking action on this kind of Loot from service center. I want hyundai to grow in Aisa market then they should think on that other wise they will also become like Chevrolet car .No one going to buy in future.But apart from maintenance cost the car is SUPERB.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;18 Feb 2020;AKMDD Ken;4.0; Occasional Commute;2020 Hyundai Creta will receive the new bumpers, different grille upfront, and slight changes in the interior. The SUV is based on second-gen ix25, which was revealed in China in the previous year. The company has said that the SUV comes with a futuristic and muscular design, improving its road presence. The side profile of the SUV looks quite right, it has 17 inches alloy wheels and bold side cre ases. The details about the interior of 2020 Hyundai Creta is yet to be revealed, and we can also expect some minor changes in the interior. The SUV offers new LED tail-lamps and a revised bumper. Installation of the dual exhaust is also expected. The SUV will share its transmission and engine with the KIA Seltos. The sale of the car will be comm3enced in later in this year in the month of March.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;11 May 2019;Aneesh Varghese;2.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;The clutch is so hard that my entire leg is paining. Driving on the crowded Bengaluru roads is a nightmare, especially with half clutch presses. I am afraid that my inguinal hernia would reappear due to the constant thrust that I"ve to exert with my left leg. The car requires frequent down shifts in the city traffic. I would have expected the creta to be fine in 3rd gear for the speed range of 20 - 40 kmph. At 25kmph, if you try to accelerate in 3rd gear, the response is so poor that even auto drivers would start honking from behind. You have to down shift to 2nd and immediately upshift to 3rd within a few seconds. Imagine doing this every now and then with a hard clutch. This is a bigger problem in highways. You are behind a bus waiting to overtake it at say 30kmph. For sudden acceleration you have to downshift to 2nd and immediately upshift your 3rd - all required before even you complete the overtaking.On ghat roads, it is between 2nd and 1st gears. I saw many cars going better than mine in those roads.Mileage in city varies from 7.5 to 10.5. In the highways you get around 15 to 17.The pros: ventilated seats, sunroof (let"s hot air escape fast), leather seats, spacious interiors, beautiful exteriors
Hyundai;Creta20152020;23 May 2020;Ravi Kumaar;4.7; Daily Commute ;It's comfortable for city & highway, leg room is adequate both front and back for six footer like me. Mileage is far than expected on NH and pretty decent in city around 14-15kmpltr. However predominantly clutch plate problem inbetween 25k to 30k...is quite bothering. On the whole iam satisfied and pat my back for choosing Creta .....
Hyundai;Creta20152020;11 Apr 2019;Manjunatha H..;2.7; Occasional Commute ;I own Hyundai Creta 2016 model. In past 3 years twice I noticed that, while vehicle is in move the steering wheel gets locked" and1it is a life threatening issue either to you or to 3rd party. Because in middle of the road, you couldn't use1your steering to turn until you switch off the engine and on it again. Hyundai service center couldn't provide assurance for permanent fix for this life threat ening problem. Looks low quality motor sensor in steering wheel. Beware of this problem while you drive/while you buy this low standard vehicle.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;20 Nov 2020;CIZER THAPA;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Mileage is not that good as i have installed both bumper guards.Maintenance is ok kind with normal servicing but parts aren't cheap.Safety is offered, We can feel it in the cabin.Being base variant there is lack of safety features.Comfort is decent, There is road noise coming to cabin.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;29 May 2019;Bonzar Brahma;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;love the easy soft handling, can turn and maneuver. The car easily in daily day to day use without any strain. Seating comfort could be better, its good but could be better. rear occupant space is good, although never got to seat there myself. 20000 kms in driver's seat in 1 and half years and still loving it. service is a little expensive and sometimes not upto mark, but could be just the service center i am visiting
Hyundai;Creta20152020;11 Mar 2020;Waheed Pasha;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;overall car is good but the maintanence cost is too high and give car servicing into service center they give you a high bill and every time I give my car into service center there is a problem in it after the delivery

Hyundai;Creta20152020;1 May 2019;Prabhu Patel;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;More than satisfied with the vehicle. Makes a great daily commuter which doubles up as the occasional tourer. We have the top spec petrol version SX+. Chose the 1.6 petrol version as our daily mileage is limited or so we thought. Diesel offers better mileage as well as is zipper to drive IMHO. Tradeoff is the extra bucks for the diesel version.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;26 Aug 2020;Khunlem Konyak;4.3; Family Car ;It is a very comfortable car, with good engine performance, safety, overall a very good car, I really like the way the petrol engine sounds but maintenance wise it is quite expensive

Hyundai;Verna20172020;30 Nov 2019;Sankar Ram;2.3; Family Car ;Poorest of poor quality mechanics. Only outside beauty and styling is there. Overheating problems still exist, even after replacing major parts including engine assembly. Moreover nobody responsible from Hyundai will even attend to your call, not even the state head. Only the local area manager will talk to you , that too in a harsh tone, as though he is the owner of HMIL and is your godfather. Ki ndly do not buy Hyundai cars.

Hyundai;i20Active;23 May 2019;Lohith N;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours;I own 2015 diesel i20 active drove 122000 as on date, if you need an hatchback with super good suspension, ground clearance and smooth engine just go for it ! Pros1)Suspension and ground clearance is super good, it has got 190mm ground clearance you can easily glide over bad and patchy roads even on tall big speed breakers with ease. 2)Comfort, it is freeking awesome 3)Good seats for long journey trust me I"m a daily highway commuter 70% of km of my car is on highway 4)Mileage on highway 18-19kmpl, city 16-17 kmpl5)Ac cools fast, it also got air vents at the back6)Good instrument cluster7)Powerful and super smooth engine 8)Lite clutch9)Wide tyres with R16 alloys Cons1)Lifeless steering, it is so lite that you can even move with your pinky finger2)Spongy brakes the abs kicks in lately3)Wipers aren"t big enough for such a big windscreen4)bumper and other fiber parts used for exterior body are not of a good quality
Hyundai;i20Active;26 Feb 2020;Jawhar Balas..;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;If you are looking for a car that is safe, performs like a pro, comfortable, with modern styling and all segment breaking creature comforts - Pls go ahead and buy i20 Active.

Hyundai;i20Active;20 Feb 2020;Kashish Dahiya;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours ;My car never let me down, be it torque, top speed, higher ground clearance, rear ac vent, tilt-telescope steering adjustment, cooled glove box, automatic climate control, auto headlights, smart key less entry, gps, diamond cut alloys, steering turning head lights, commutative reverse camera. All in all I would say best premium hatch back in India under 10 lakhs.
Hyundai;i20Active;30 Jul 2019;Anil Das;4.0; Family Car ;I owned i20 active SX (P) last year, 2018 face lift and driven 15000 km. Pros are the superb riding quality, comfort, cooling, music with 4+4 speakers, light steering, strong built body and easy shifting of gears. Cons are the fuel consumption which is about 8-9 kmpl in the city and 14-15 kmpl on highways while in AC on condition. The visual quality of cladding on external parts is poor as it look s faded black color but is strong. Important features lack on the top model too as break assist, distance to empty, traction control, average/ instantaneous fuel consumption etc. However the featured car i am satisfied with.

Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;9 Nov 2019;Deepranjan G..;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Our first preference was to buy Ford figo but the varriant we wanted ford couldn't deliver so we choosed Elite i20 petrol and after 2 years I think it was best decision. We had a little less budget so we purchased the era varriant that is very rare and difficult to get. We bought it in 2017 november. I am driving the car for 2 years. Done about 9000 kilometers. The only one thing to sacrifice abou t it is the milage. I am a light footed driver. Always shift to 5 th gear in 60kmph and very ocassionally go over 100kmph. I get milage about 9-10 in town with ac and 13-15 in highway. But for its very good built quality and comfort I never mind for it. And one more thing I am talking about 2017 model. One of my friend bought 2018 model he is getting 11 in town and 16-17 in highway. For the people who prefers cars which give peace of mind while driving prefers a car which is very easy and efortless to drive i20 is one of the best 5 seaters under 10 lakhs for them. Talking about maintanance, Out of 3 service 2 service is the major oil change service which I had to pay the for consumables and for wheel balancing and allignment. In 1st year oil change service I paid 1950 including engine oil oil filter and wheel balancing. In 2nd year service I paid about 2850 including Engine oil, Oil filter, Air filter, Wheel Balancing and Wheel allignment. According to my idea its very reasonable. For my experience in 2 years If someone looking for a family car for driving 3-4 days in a week and 500-600 km in a month and go for long rides ocassionally then i20 is best hatchback for them. Backseat space is also great so 5 adults can seat in the car for long rides.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;31 Jul 2020;Dheeraj Pareek;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The Car is literally good for those who are going to buy there first car as its a hassle free car, for new people they don't have knowledge that what happens when you buy a car and find noisy cabins and less styling feature & safety features inside a car. although i will say Hyundai never claimed good averages in any of there Petrol car but if you want a Mileage machine i will say its better to sk ip Petrol and get the Diesel or go for Maruti Suzuki as they are famous for making mileage machine cars.i almost get a 18-22kmpl in highways or on long routes if you drive like 70-80kmph then you can get easily 17-18kmpl. In City well i live in a small city so on average if i drive 5-15km then i would get 10-12kmpl at maximum. if you extend it to like 30kmpl there is a chance you can get 15kmpl at maximum depends how gentle you drive your car.if you drive like 50-70kmph then definitely you will get more then 19 and even can go upto 22kmpl but trust me that would take your time, and if time is not your priority in that case you can really achieve good mileage.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;2 Dec 2020;Shreyansh Ja..;4.3; Daily Commute ;Elite i20 is a decent package by hyundai.It provides better styling, Features and road presence than its other rivals.But if you are a car enthusiast who loves acceleration, Then this car is not for you.You can try its turbo petrol but still not up to its mark.Its build quality is fabulous.No crinkle sound from the panels even after many years.Touch and feel of interior is definitely up to its mar k, Gives you a feeling of luxury.Handling is decent.But at high speeds like 100 or above.It definitely don't give you the confidence.Seats are comfortable.But you sit a bit lower comparing to its rivals.Breaking is also good.Better safety options.You'll feel it's 1.2l kappa petrol engine underpowered sometimes.You need to downshift the gears for overtaking.So, If you are a smooth driver and for whom powerful performance is not primary, Then this car is for you.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;24 Nov 2020;Abhijit Ray;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I am a bit disappointed while comparing this version of i20 with my previously owned 2009 model i20. Its seems that the internal space has somehow been compromised, ride quality has gone down. However places where this car puts a smile on my face is - 1. Styling - it definitely is a gorgeous piece of art. 2. The keen eye to features which really matters - speed sensing door locks, automatic head l amps, rear camera with guidelines, door ajar warning.. just to name a few. 3. Right Sizing - the vehicle is nor too crammed up neither too spacious (compared to its older sibling) and thus fits into quite a number of tough parking spots in the city. 4. The aftersales service - not sure if hyundai solves all your problem or not but does sincerely listens. You can count on one fact, they will value your time.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;27 Jun 2020;Rahul Singh;3.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have been driving this car from 5 years really had a very good experience with this car evn I have taken this car to the mountains tosh Manali loved it to ride evn there. Very comfortable on long drives too It gives you a smooth ride where ever you take this car The draw back is the rear sitting space for long drives I could recommend only 2 persons at the rear if you want to enjoy your journey second thing that sucks is the mileage with the petrol version it delivers only 12 km in the city and 14 -15 on the high way About safety I had 2 Major accident with this car but still we were safe Notting happened due too it's build quality thank God I was not driving a maruti car . In terms off saftey this car will never let you happen any thing
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;26 Nov 2019;David S;3.3; Daily Commute ;Very nice. Sale Executive respond and explain everything about the Do & Don't of the vehicle and what is the function and how to operate with all the Features provided.I am worried only with the poor mileage. 10 to 12 KMPL in the city, 15 to 16 KMPL in the highway. Since i'm from Shillong the Hilly areas, found that the performance is very weak. Little bit up or hilly vehicle wont go in a 2nd Gear . About Features i really appreciated, its really well and good. Vehicle is very stable no vibration even at the speed of about 120KMPH or 150KMPH. Only the SEAT is not comfortable as it is created as a Box type, for a long journey its really create a back pain and uncomfortable.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;27 Sep 2019;Rohit B;5.0; Daily Commute ;I own the Hyundai I20 since 2016.Hyundai i20 is an amazing car, the driving experience is excellent, good acceleration and worth buying this car. The car has great safety features, music system, excellent sound quality. A.C, of the car gives proper cooling. The car is much spacious with ample legroom. It has great boot space.Hyundai i20 is my favorite car ever I bought it before 2.5 year. Still, I didn"t find any problems in my car that is how good it is. Hyundai has done a great job in making this car. I have completed 36000 kilometers but still, it is very good in the condition so it is good to go for the i20.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;30 Sep 2020;S Sivarao;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Very Good car to travel within city or on highways. Front seats are quite comfortable. Thigh Support in back seats could be better. Overall Good for 4 people. Drive quality is superb. Feels so safe to drive at very high speeds also. Mileage in city traffic is average. On highway, when you go around 70-100kmph car will give you mileage of around 17kmpl. Above 100kmph even 15kmpl is doubtful. In cit y conditions, 12-14 depending on traffic and clutch usage. Struggles to pickup once speed goes down to zero but once it gets going drives amazingly fast. Boot space is small. Overall love my car.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;14 Jan 2020;Subhamoy Cha..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Beautiful, powerful, comfortable, equipped, wide, spacious, lively car. Only that inspite best of my efforts, I have never been able to cross the 12kmpl barrier. I calculate: total KMS ÷ fuel used (full tank auto cut off to full tank auto cut off). The refuelling gives the total fuel used and use against the KMS cat had run. on highways, I have got a Max of 15 kmpl, driving very technically corre ct with the company recommendation and maintaining all technical limitations. and facing some it's and bits problems, calling for a molestation of my wallet. But still, overall a very good car.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;10 Oct 2020;Samiran Hand..;3.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I wish I had bought Venue instead which was just launched. I didnt knw how the pertrol engine is in I20. Best hatchback till 2019. 2020 onwards the car are much better equipped and stylish. Plus the performance of I20 from my personal experience is not that great. It asks to drive calmly, sudden overtakes will need gear downshifts otherwise you can drive easily on lower power/torque during lower r evs on higher gears eg 1.5rpm at 4th gear or 5th gear at a slow speed city bumper to bumper movement. The is definitely smooth and comfortable on bad roads and long drives.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;19 Aug 2018;Vinay Gupta;4.0; Daily Commute ;it's a good car. Very good comfort level, good build quality materials used inside & outside of car but need to compromise with mileage of petrol i20. But one thing sure once you enter inside of car & drive it, you feel premium car like Audi driving experience. Performance wise car takes times to get pick up in 2nd gear, It easily go 60 - 100 km without any extra efforts very smoothly after 1500 - 200 RPM. Need to say if you are looking for premium class with good comfort can go blindly with i20 but mileage wise slightly slow compare to any Maruti vehicles... What else to say further.... As i have Elite i 20 Asta O Petrol 2017 model and driving busy Bangalore city traffic gets around 11 -12 km in city & highway around 14 - 16 km depends driving pattern. You can easily get around 16 km with smooth driving on highway & 12 km in city with full time Ac. Even i gets same till now. Maintenance come around 5- 7 thousands with service interval 10000 km.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;25 Sep 2019;Raju Dave;1.7; Daily Commute ;it"s a worse car, very poor pickup due to rubber band effect.diffcult to overtake other vehicles on highway. I sold out my new car with in 2 months due to above problem. Mileage is also very poor in city traffic 9-10 kms only. it"s my heartily request to all of you don"t by cvt, AMT cars go for DSG transmission like Volkswagen Polo GTI or Vento Tsi. If you have any doubt call me on 902****441.

Hyundai;Tucson20162020;23 May 2019;;4.7; Tours | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;As i belong to a northeast state mizoram,where the roads are in very very bad condition,so i needed something strong in the engine and a good ground clearance, and the most important of all showroom and servicing centre, i really wanted to have a jeep compass but we dont have a showroom nearby, the nearest is guwahati which is more than 400 kms with the worst damaged roads from my place to the ser vicing centre,but i wanted an SUV which has a servicing center near by me, so in SUV our state has Hyundai, Ford, Nissan,Renault n Mahindra,so i decided to do a survey and found that Tucson is the best choice for me, there is ford endeavour but the price and the height due to which its very difficult to see whats infront of me, Duster, mahindra are very common in our state, so i thought whh dont i try Hyundai Tucson by Hyundai, but the Hyundai showroom did not have a Tucson for trial, as the price was a ove 20 lakhs so they told me that they will have to book, as even guwahati didnt have stock, so Hyundai placed an order from the Hyundai plantwhich took 5 months to reach my place, and when it reached ,Hyundai released a statement that i was the first one in north east (7 states) to have a Tucson, and it made a good impact on my social network.Now let me come to the experience, its really a perfect SUV ,ground clearance is good and the engine, its a blast good pick up, the modes are very useful and the looks i dont think anyother SUV can be compared to the awesome looks of Tucson, its like everything is perfect.Interior is one of the best designs in this segment with one of the best music system and semi woofers , so smooth that you cant even know the engine is on or off and can climb or cross rivers and run on the worst roadswithout any problem.its the best SUV in its segment

Hyundai;EON;10 Jun 2020;Vyshak Reghu..;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;For an 800cc car, this is a very good performer. However the mileage has taken quite a huge setback at about 11-12 kmpl. There is no RPM-meter which makes it tricky to get optimal performance. However the small size as well as the radical styling of this car is stupendous. Driving in small lanes is a breeze even when there is a huge truck coming towards you. For people living in rented places with no parking, this car is so easy to park in any corner of the building, road, etc. Parking at roadsides when making purchases and other daily activities make this an excellent daily car.It is unfortunate that Hyundai exited this segment, as well as never promoted this car as much as the i10/20s. They should've added more safety and security features to this car as well as regular updates.
Hyundai;EON;14 Jan 2020;Akash Mukherjee;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;This is my first car and i am very happy with it this car is excellent for daily commute as per the size of the car it is very easy to drive in heavy traffic in city . If i talk about front look this car is getting the signature fluidic design which every Hyundai car gets and it's is very easy to do some modifications with looks from the front side . Overall i am using this car since 3 years i nev er regret that whether i should oft for renault kwid Hyundai Eon engine is more superior than renault kwid (800cc) Interior design is also appealing to me if anyone think of buying used eon i am definitely going to recommend
Hyundai;EON;5 May 2020;Dr Mahesh;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;Eon is a small family car and value for money. Driving experience is very good on highways but not a good car for Indian kaccha roads. It creates lot of suspension noise inside the cabin while driving on kaccha roads. The engine is very silent but when fully boarded with 5 seats it don't provide sufficient power to pull the car even after shifting to lower gears. Sometimes engine don't take the lo ad after gear shift..
Hyundai;EON;4 Mar 2020;Rohit Kapil;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;it's 814 cc engine is more punchy than 998cc engine of my wagon R. more comfortable very good breaking interior feeling like 7 lac segment car. low ground clearance gives very good driving pleasure. 2 times on the speed of approximately 80km hr accidentally took you turn and car slipped to you turn. lowered ground clearance helped me to slide like you turn without accident.thanks Hyundai.
Hyundai;EON;28 Aug 2019;Neel;3.7; Family Car ;It"s a great replacement for other small hatchbacks in its price range... Specially the main competitor Alto by Maruti Suzuki. Because it"s stylish, small, pocket friendly, reliable engine (because it"s Hyundai), and has every thing thing to offer that a middle class future car owner looks for in their first car.

Interior is best in class2. Handling is best even in tight roads can give confidence to drive it,thanks to EPS ....N that was not available in a step up cars when it entered .3.Descent milage4.Overall quality of the product is best.5.Service co st is also reasonable.6. Utilisation of space is done excellent in cabin7.Promising in this price tagScope for improvement1. ENGINE must have 1.2 2.rear suspension is far away from comfort3. As engine is small when use AC with pillion passengers even 5 people the performance drops drastically4. Lower variants why cost cutting is done don't know...?Eg.Wheel size is 12 inches so more bumps on rear side...How much had saved...😢Don't know5. Discountinuoued what was the mistake of those who bought this with trust....Instead of this they should have been brought it with new attractive functionalities so as to cope up with competition....

Honda;City;31 Dec 2020;Easwaramurth..;1.0; Daily Commute ;My honda city car- tn43k 5445- suddenly stopped on 28-12-2020 and never started again.Road side assistance was called for and vehicle was towed to nearby honda service centre “mysore inspiron honda”.After a day i was informed the fuel pump has to be replaced.I never expected a reputed company like honda to deliver a car with defective fuel pump.Adding fuel to the fire i was told to wait for at least 10 to 12 days for replacement.Now my question is what arrangements honda is to make for my conveyance.Does honda provide me a spare car or does it bear the cost.Even if you rectify the car what guarantee is there that it will not happen again? honda very well knew this persisting problem with city and amaze but my vehicle was not called for rectification.I never saw any other branded car stopped in the middle of the road during this era.Shame on honda.Expecting a good reply from honda.Other wise i will have to look for other options.

Honda;City;12 Dec 2020;Anish Morey;5.0; Daily Commute ;I am using the 2014 top end diesel manual variant of the honda city and i am Very happy with the car except for a couple of issues. The front bonnet alignment of honda city is very poor and the bumper always tends to come out of its clips. I have noticed this in a lot of honda city cars on road and the company just changes the bushings but that too stays for a couple of weeks or so. I think honda really needs to have a look on this point.Secondly my car has a leakage issue since a very long time from the doors during heavy monsoon seasons or when i take my car for a wash at the washing centers, and the company has not been able to solve it at all even after keeping the car for a couple of weeks for inspection. And the height is, my cars inside flooring is filled with water from the overnight rains for almost 4 -5 times. So i have found a solution for it myself. Otherwise the engine is very smooth and the car has no other technical issues. I have been using it for over 6 years now and still there is no sound from the interior plastics too. I manage to get a good average of about 22 - 23.There is no car in this segment that gives as much leg room as this car considering my height is 6'3" and i sit very comfortably in both, the front as well as the rear seat. The rear seat comfort is great even for long drives but in the front seat, i do face back ache during long drives.Overall i am very happy with the purchase and would recommend going in for the same model.
Honda;City;25 Sep 2020;Mahesh Bibave;4.3; Daily Commute;Very nice car at all but ground clearance is very low I replaced tyres of 195/65R15 to increase it's ground clearance.

Honda;Amaze;11 Aug 2020;Rajat Sharma;4.0; Family Car ;I purchased Honda on the year it was launched 2013 (Purchased Dec 2013). It's a budget friendly car & gives me good mileage. City 14-16 kmplHighway 18-19 kmplService cost approx 3200-3500 per yearInterior - Basic (Very Simple)Exterior - BasicBoot Space - OKMusic System - Very Good (Simple)Ground Clearance - Ok (Depends on the rider though I drove it in Hills area & haven't yet faced any kind of pr oblem yet)Cons - Chasis is not so heavy so whenever you drive at speed of 100 above & then tries to reduce the speed by switching gear & reduce speed simultaneously in short time it's body gets j****d but only it feels to the driver. I thoroughly studied it & found that due to light weight chasis it gets j****d otherwise it's pick up speed is very very good.
Honda;Amaze;25 Jan 2019;Amal Das;4.0; Family Car ;Amaze can"t overcome hills.Low power is main issue I found and it"s only in petrol version.I am also one of the happy customer of Honda until driving a hill or ascent.Amaze can"t overcome ascents.Its the only issue i found since driving 3000km,which is not an acceptable issue.When i contacted Honda they said its handed over to dealer,but the dealer informed Honda that they didn"t find any abnormal ity in my car which they accepted that Amaze has power issue and its for maintaining mileage once i was there at showroom.And when i asked dealer about their reply to Honda they said its made like that they can"t tell this to Honda,if we want to ride hills we must choose another vehicle and they can"t fit same Honda engine on both boat and car(just imagine my situation hearing this kind of reply from dealers).Really pathetic situation. So, dear brothers and sisters please don"t buy amaze petrol.If you like Amaze go for diesel.All other features in amaze are good.I choose petrol because i am not aware of this power issue and now suffering for my choice.My bad i have test driven Amaze but not on an ascents. When you people ask sales person about this power issue they will reply there is nothing like that,better have a test drive with the same sales person on a hill or ascent and ask him to stop car in middle and then move, you can experience what i was saying about.
Honda;Amaze;21 Sep 2020;Mahadevan Si..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Man, this car is a performance beast. I get around 25 kms on highways (Chennai to Trichy) if I do not exceed 90kmps. It has excellent power of 1500cc four cylinder 16 valve DOHC. But maintenance is a problem. Every 6 months we will have to service it and the service cost around Rs.9000.- per service. once the car crosses 30000 kms, honda service people starting that you will have to change the clu tch plate, ( which is around Rs.35000/-), change the brakes (Around Rs,18000) after 50000kms starting telling that the shock absorber is to be changed. ( which is again around Rs.20000). The cost of the engine oil is also high around Rs.4000/- approximate which has to be changed every 6 months.
Honda;Amaze;27 Jul 2019;Suresh Sahad..;4.7; Family Car ;Following is a review on the Honda Amaze Petrol after 5000kms. Looks: The overall silhouette of the new Amaze is good. It now looks like a bigger car compared to the previous version. I am not a big fan of the thick chrome grill at the front. The headlamps are stylish. The rear looks good with C-shaped lamps and sloping roof.Performance: The engine is super smooth and the gears are slick. Frequent gear changing is required but the performance is good. The initial pickup is low to maintain fuel economy. The car feels best on the highway. Feels stable even at speeds of 120kmph.Interiors: The interior is spacious and comfortable. The beige and piano black finish looks classy. The AC is quick and powerful. The rear seats offer ample legroom. The door speakers produce good sound. Audio controls are present on the steering wheel. The boot is spacious at 420 liters.Mileage: For a 1.2 liter petrol sedan, the mileage is good. It offers about 18.5 kmpl on the highway and 14-15 kmpl in the city with AC.Ride and Stability: The wheels soak up most bumps effortlessly. The ride quality is good. The stability at high speeds is good and body roll is controlled.Overall: Value for money. Spacious interiors and boot space. Good mileage and ride comfort.
Honda;Amaze;9 Jan 2019;Bees Cmrit;4.7; Family Car | Tours ;1. Honda Elite Cars Rajahmundry delivery my car in time as they promised to me.After reviewing Swift,Xcent and Ertiga i decided to by New Honda Amaze.I have seen so may bad review in amaze but my friend who is service engineer of Top Brand told that New Amaze is best in segment . Also service cost is low as so many told that Honda car service is High.2. I completed my 900 KMS traveled continuously for 300 KMS i did not feel any discomfort while journey. But the same journey with Etois i feel so much discomfort . Normally when we travel in car we feel dizzy but with amaze while riding we feel as we are at home . AC is very good no need for Rear AC vent.3. From far its looks like Volvo car. Mileage is good got AVG 21KMPL with in local and Highway. Some reviews told there is a problem in reverse gear but it is totally wrong.4. yet to give to service 5. Pros:Lots of boot Space, Leg room , Audio is Superb when compared to other cars . Diesel engines are noisy but Amaze engine is low noise like petrol engine. AC is very good no need for Rear AC vent.Cons: Some told that it has no resale value. But with Honda Pre owned car and its brand its not a big issue it think.
Honda;Amaze;9 Nov 2019;Aman Chhikara;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Suspension quality is very poor. Honda Amaze has extremely soft suspension which results in high body roll and poor ground clearance.Build quality of both interior and exterior parts are very poor. External noise enters in cabin very easily. Engine quality is excellent but there's a speed limiter on 145KM/Hour which is for safety reasons obviously but it makes the car out of the competition when i t comes to the top speed.Overall I'm neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with it but yes, not happy with the build quality and suspension system. I have a 2017 model petrol SMT model.
Honda;Amaze;29 May 2020;Anuj Gupta;3.7; Family Car ;I have recently faced fuel pump failure issue . Car was parked and weekly I was doing start and running, battery was ok but all of sudden one day it did not started and cause was bad fuel pump. Its very sad that a car which we bought new has manufacturing issue of fuel pump failure. In case I would have travelling and then it happened then think how much painfully it would be.So later I called the service center and they sent their mechanic to replace new fuel pump without any charges.I urge Honda to recall all faulty cars of bad fuel pumps.
Honda;Amaze;26 Jun 2020;PRANAV JOSHI;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Great car. I've bought Honda Amaze SMT second model in September 2018. DSL. I'm fully satisfied with this car. By profession I'm in business of tours and travels. I've driven this car by me & my professional drivers about 75k till today. Maintenance is not so costly.fual mileage is also good. AC is also powerfulSome of to my drivers giving 28-30 kmpl. Some time in rough driving gives 20-25 kmpl. B y impression of good performance I've also taken another car same model, same veriant in August 2019.
Honda;Amaze;12 Aug 2020;Arit Dey;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours ;Overall performance of petrol automatic is great in the city. It has paddle shifts which are effective in hilly areas. Many complain about the low torque and poor pick up but it totally depends on how you control the car. Best thing about the CVT in the hills it does not decent back immediately in a climb when brakes are released. City average is 12 kmpl with ac on. High mileage is better. Service of Honda is fair enough. Car is very smooth and comfortable and engine is quite silent.
Honda;Amaze;6 Jul 2020;Varun Verma;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;My Amaze emt petrol is 1.5 years old, i am pretty impressed with the style safety design and performance of this car, but if you love to drive on mountains or if you need an instant pickup this car lacks this, pickup is one of my big concern over this car, it may differ to driver to driver, but i think this is one of the best compact sedan in this budget. I have to buy music syste wheel cover, and exterior accessories from outside it costs around 7-10,000.
Honda;Amaze;27 Aug 2020;Govardhan B;3.7; Daily Commute ;The Vehicle is absolute spacious and elegant. engine is always smooth. but the Dash Board and System is very odd looking and Honda has never changed the style and looks very legacy type.also, the pickup is sluggish but once it hits highway the engine runs like an Horse...over all i am happy but not that very much as compared to other cars in the market. they need to improve the style and Interior and keep up the mileage good.

Honda;Amaze;4 Aug 2020;Sathiyan Tha..;3.3; Family Car ;Mileage not as expected .Even though the company is claiming 19 kmpl ,it never exceeds 14 kmpl till date.But I do hope that mileage will increase after III service.Moreover I experienced very difficult when it happened to stop at the mid of uphill and then climb.The pick up is not as expected.However travelling in more or less levelled road is very comfortable and is also worth for the amount paid .
Honda;Amaze;21 Sep 2018;Chandan Seet..;4.7; Daily Commute ;I bought the iDTEC Amaze in January 2014, and have run over 1,10,000 KM over varied terrains. The Amaze is definitely the best car in its segment. With amazing performance and fantastic mileage, coupled with great road grip, handling and safety, this is the car you should look at over any other in its segment. The car handles very well on the highway and has more than enough oopmh to overtake any vehicle on the road. A super responsive engine, you will experience no turbo lag.Be vary of unnecessary service add ons though. When you give the car for service, they’ll try to get you to sign unnecessary “value add ons” like rodent repellent, etc etc which can add thousands to your service bill.
Honda;Amaze;26 Jul 2020;Mukund Krish..;4.3; Family Car ;Honda is a great car that combines style, safety, comfort and ease of maintenance. My amaze gives 12km in city and 20 on highways. Handling is very good. Maintenance is not a pinch, only thing is need to be aware of the Garage, Hope a Honda EV comes out fast.. Hear that they are getting out a Jazz EV. If the same Jazz looks are maintained in the EV model it will be a hit.
Honda;Amaze;26 Oct 2020;Manish Yadav;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Haven't driven much. But still, feel the car can respond to my driving moods n requirements. City highway. Smooth and hard. Haven't pushed the car much. But in two situations it behaved stable n powerful. So liking it gradually. I also drive an XUV 500 and have been driving 2 small cars Santos and Altos. So I expect a lot from amaze. Hope it amazes me.
Honda;Amaze;24 Sep 2020;Deepesh Saini;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I purchased honda amaze in thr month of Oct 2019. Now almost a year I must say the car is great. It gives Mileage easily around 15 to 16 in city and 19-20 km/l in highway. Very comfortable and spacious. Small issue is with the body of the car as its feels less strong. But, comfort, mileage, boot space, looks are good. Overall great buy.
Honda;Amaze;23 Dec 2020;Aritra Mitra;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Comfort and performance oriented car. Mileage could've been improved. It's fun to drive in city and also in highway. Love the styling after Honda Amaze facelift. It's a great choice within 10 lakhs budget. A great alternative to Maruti Swift Dzire. Afterall Honda is Honda once the iv-tech kicks in, it's just adrenaline rush.
Honda;Amaze;10 Aug 2020;Hardik Gupta;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car;Best car in segment...The looks and features are amazing..my experience with Honda amaze is completed with 10000kms of running...The engine is powerful...just a point to notice that the car is not long routes as the steering is a bit heaving which makes the person feel tired faster...But the carr is awesome

Honda;Amaze;8 Dec 2020;;2.0; Family Car ;The mileage has been very poor right from day one.! compared to a vw vento that i also own, I feel completely at risk when i drive this car because its handling is so flimsy, And it seems that it would go flying it someone were to hit me from behind - not very uncommon on our roads.!.
Honda;Amaze;29 Sep 2020;Dr Sameer;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Driving a compact Sedan like Amaze really amazed me .

Honda;Amaze;9 Oct 2020;Simon Samuel;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Its a superb joy ride. I love driving my Amaze. Very responsive steering. The best compact sedan I guess. However not so good for a bumpy road. The suspension is on the softer side, so gives a premium feeling in a city ride, and even in highways, considering the road is good.
Honda;Amaze;20 Sep 2020;Abhijeet Singh;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am proud of me that i have own Honda Amaze because in this segment it is overall the best car in comparison to Dzire, Aura and other cars.

Honda;Amaze;22 Nov 2019;Shiv Narang;4.3; Daily Commute ;Steering is oil controlled, and not power control. Similarly head rest in the seats can't be adjusted. Few cut offs every here and there. Better to opt for Honda City. Although it has the same 1.5 L diesel engine which goes for Honda City, which is big plus for performance.

Honda;Amaze;28 Jul 2019;Krishnendu Paul;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Owning it since 2016 october, petrol SMT version, really good car for city ride and long rides too. Given the road space in Calcutta, getting good mileage with a/c always on round the year, about 15-18kmpl and on the highways around 20-21kmpl. Doesnt get fatigued while driving this car in the city or in the country side.Value for money, if we keep the car with proper and timly servicing through th e honda suthorised service centers.

Honda;Amaze;9 Sep 2019;Vraj Gokani;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Driving on highway during night experienced less lights and power lag in 2nd shift more particularly 3 to 2,i.e. in downshift. DRL is required, but installing from after market runs with voiding warranty. Driving is comfortable and smooth. It give 12 km mileage in city and 20 plus on highway. GPS system is having older version, so it requires some up-gradation so that it becomes easy to find new r ide over bridges etc. Spare wheel should be of same size, it is of 14" and not alloys.

Honda;Civic;12 Sep 2019;JNithish Fdo;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Love my Civic 1.8 iVtec The car is 12years old by 2019 and still feels like day 1 The engine has just done over 102000 KMs and the performance is just still surprising and exciting till date Has Loads of space in the cabin and The beige coloured Seats and upholstery gives a special airy feel The steering is slightly on the Heavier side feels like a task when pulling through tight gaps and small ro ads The headlights have an amazing spread but the intensity of the lights are just on the dimmer side which doesn"t feel so good and confident on the highway during night times so it"s better to go with After market LED bulbs just like I did and the experience afterwards is just blisteringly awesome City Fuel economy is around 11 kmpl which is quite impressive for the size of the engine and the power it offers highway fuel economy is around 14kmpl(110 cruising speed with boosts up to 150km occasionally) and can be pushed to 18 with Economic and conservative driving.Regular services do not cost much but tinkering works and any other mechanical parts replacement are gonna piss you off so be careful around Tight spaces and your driving style The ground clearance is not much of a con it only becomes a problem if you have 4 or 5 adults onboard and crossing speed breakers The car has an aerodynamic shape and which reduces Wind Drag and improves ride quality Fuel economy and performancePersonal Top speed of the car is close to 210 while company claimed and other sources say it can reach 225kmh The car has an incredibly low height which makes it mission impossible for elderly people to get in and get out The 6 speaker (4 speakers + 2 Tweeters) Honda audio provides a blissful experience with Aux connectivity The boot is adequately sized at 430L which I personally find as more than adequate (segment lower cars have larger capacity boots)With 50L of fuel tank capacity (5 reserve)Long trips can be accomplished without fuel stops
Honda;Civic;1 Jan 2021;Narayan Subr..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Very reliable.Not a thing has gone wrong ever since i purchased this car.Upgraded my infotainment system to the sony xav ax 5000 system thats android auto compatible.Performance is quite good.Upgrading from a santro, Needs a bit of getting to the acceleration characteristics.Needs a lot more throttle input, But once you get used to it, You'll find the engine is very responsive!gc is good, But the wheelbase being longer, Need to be a little mindful over breakers, But its not restrictive in anyway.Have driven fairly aggressively within the city and its never bottomed out.Really good service as well!.
Honda;Civic;25 Dec 2020;Sugandh Sriv..;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Loved this car but the only drawback is the lower ground clearance which is not according to Indian roads. A medium size speed breaker can also be felt with this car. I don't feel like driving it when I see path holes on the road. A higher ground clearance should have been anticipated by Honda for Indian roads.
Honda;Civic;3 Nov 2020;Pc Sharma;4.7; Family Car ;Overall performance of this car is excellent except average which is low it is driven only 30000+ kms in 14 years due to another car swift of 2007 model already sold after completed more than one lack kms.Now i want to buy one cvt car with best features like nissan magnite in cvt model.
Honda;Civic;22 Apr 2019;Richard Rozario;5.0; Daily Commute ;Usually, a lot of migrates go in for second hand cars. I don't understand the logic behind it. Could be that they haven't driven a car in India or wherever they came from. No issues with them. I had a Hyundai Xcel which was a 2 door hatchback. I happened to visit the Honda showroom in my city and found the Honda Civic- a European model hatchback that was up for sale. This used to be the demo car. I picked up the offer and I'm happy with it.

Honda;Jazz;8 Oct 2020;Sivasaravanan S;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Honda Jazz Petrol CVT - Really a nice family car. I drove around 46000+ Km in 3 years and no issues at all. Servicing costs within limits -Rs. 3000 - 5000(approx.) / Service-> Thanks to Sundaram Honda for their Genuine service billing unlike other dealers. The best part is, refined engine with CVT makes the car to reach speed of 100 Kmph even below 2000 RPM and that is getting translated to me in terms of mileage and smoothness.
Honda;Jazz;27 Dec 2020;Krishna Chai..;4.7; Family Car | Tours ;Ivtec is butter smooth and one should have to go through a little learning curve to open up the performance, Which is like any other car.Absolutely comfortable for family of four.We never get tired even after long hours of journey.Am saying this after numerous journeys did ~600-800 kms per day and overall run of ~55000 kms.
Honda;Jazz;29 Oct 2020;Revati Ahuja;1.0; Daily Commute;Just a warning for all the upcoming honda jazz owners.The headlights have a focussing issue and the intensity is poor.Worse than there brio which is making the driving experience a difficult one.Kindly test drive it at night to know what i am saying.Only the top variant has the led lamps like all other honda cars.

Honda;Jazz;10 Sep 2020;Arun Rajan;4.0; Daily Commute ;To me this car is an absolute heaven.Such a breeze in heavy traffic and equally impressive for highway drives.Mine gets to sixty miles per hour in second gear itself.When the signal goes green and the traffic fades away on the rear you know you are in a special car.Also it humiliates much bigger sized sedans due to its impressive acceleration.
Honda;WRV;8 Nov 2020;Pankaj Gupta;1.0; Daily Commute ;We bought wrv honda car in dec’2017 from prime honda showroom, Patparganj, New delhi, India and within the warranty period our music system display stopped working.Warranty they provide is for 3 years.Rude behavior of staff.No professionism.There’s no time guarantee/limit when it comes to after sales service in warranty period.The service within the warranty period is horrible and pathetic or is there’s any worst word than that? within the warranty period our music system touch screen stopped working.It has been more than 2 months since we registered our complain against the music system to get replaced.We got the complain registered on 20th august, 2020.Since then we have been going to the showroom again and again and we have been asking them on call that when is it going to get change.Person who sits on front desk i.E.Ms.Lata, She spoke really rudely to us and also her manager mr.Sudhir.Our phone calls aren’t answered and if in any case they answer our call, They disconnect our call.Is this what you called the professionalism or after sales service??? we have recorded all calls and can provide to anyone.We have been asking the time period that when are we going to receive the new music system because it have been 2 months now and interiors of the car without a music system is useless.They themselves don’t know when it is going to arrive.So that means if it doesn’t come in 6 months or even a year then we are going to stay without a music system for next 6 months and even a year because it isn’t coming from the company.Excuse me?? are we fools here who are going to get fooled by you?? that is the after sales service you provide? or call it in warranty.Sorry but the warranty service offered by honda is really bad.So if people reading my review still wants to buy wrv or any other honda car because all cars have music touch system now and wants to waste money then go ahead and dare it to waste it because our complains are heard by no one in honda.We have freaking paid you for all this.You arent doing it for free.If we had to pay money for it then for sure next day only the music system would have arrived.It’s shocking to see such a well-known company with such disgusting after sales services and the behavior of the staff of prime honda showroom in patparganj.Feels like all positive reviews are fake on google and on the other websites.If any higher authority is reading this review then kindly contact p******2@gamil.Com because we are sick and tired of calling and going to the showroom again and again.And our complain isn’t getting heard.Wish we never bought this car.

Honda;Jazz20182020;22 Jun 2020;Krishna Tiru..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car;The current Jazz offered in both petrol and diesel variants is very pricey compared to its rivals. The only value plus points of Jazz are well refined 1.2 L petrol engine(+), CVT(++) and cabin/ boot space(+++). The attractive feature is rear tail LED lamps. The body built of the Jazz is sturdy and seems a real metal. All other specifications and features of Jazz fall far behind the competition. Ev en top variants do not get: R16 tyres, Auto head lamps, Rain sensing wipers, Rear head rests, Rear AC, DRLs, LED-projector head lamps, Cooled glove box, Rear arm rest and IVRS auto dimming that are offered on Altroz, i20, Baleno, Kwid, Micra etc.The main dis-advantages of Jazz are: too many blind spots, expensive service costs (with horrible 6 month interval), touch AC- not easy to set while driving, dual horn may not be reachable to small palms (so you have to remove one hand from steering to use the horn), spare tyre is R14 steel and front arm rest which is positioned too low to use. In some areas, after sales-service is also not professional. There are some other features in the top variants which are of rear use on Indian roads like cruise control and paddle shifts (that gives a sporty feeling though).Of course Honda dedicated years on cosmetic changes like addition of DRLs, LED projectors (this year), push start, rear LED tail lamps, Digipad 2.0, capacitive touch door handles (Last year) etc.6 x bottle holders are standard across all the variants of JAZZ (petrol and Diesel). No worries.For a solid built hatchback with best in market auto-transmission(CVT), with refined engine and lots of space inside cabin and as well boot space I suggest you go for Jazz. If you are looking for a manual transmission car.....m m m m m.
Honda;Jazz20182020;8 Jul 2019;Prodeep Ghosh;2.7; Occasional Commute ;I have the automatic and it's for my daughter. It's a well engineered petrol vehicle, the automatic is fine but not peppy enough. If you are looking to overtake at high double digits on a highway, you really have to rev it up. What's disappointing is the lack of nice features that are engineered in but not made functional. It has a provision for keyless but not enabled. Of the two sets of keys - o ne has remote door opening the other is a standard insert and turn. The turn indicators are little cheap, plastic inserts on sides though the rear view mirrors have a notch for the same. The cabin is drab and unimaginative. Anyone with an i20 experience will feel the difference. For its price it is highly underscored. Drive is fine though torque build up is poor. True to Honda petrol, the car has never given me any issues at all over the last 4.5 years. It has decent enough storage (400L + I think) and good for long drives. Overall solid, functional but completely unimaginative and low featured.
Honda;Jazz20182020;5 Aug 2020;Sandeep Singh;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am driving my Jazz since 2015 and even till now, it seems same feeling. Its been 4.5 years and i drove more than 80 thousand KM . but believe me, drive quality, comfort, glass view are really good. On the highway, we get 20+ average ( need to drive below 100) and in city its 18 KMPL( with A/C) . The maintenance cost is coming around 8 to 9 thousand. So after 4.5 year i can say that i am a proude owner of such a reliable car.
Honda;Jazz20182020;26 Feb 2020;Kishore Varma;5.0; Daily Commute ;This is my first car, 5 years now.

Mileage : 12kmpl city, 16-17kmpl highway with max speed 100 [without AC 19 kmpl], cost is a premium, but you get what you pay. I am satisfied custome r.thank you honda ..!
Honda;Jazz20182020;28 Mar 2019;Ashwin Thakare;3.3; Family Car ;A good family car. Always loved Honda Jazz. Good on space and comfort. Engine is super refined. The ivtec is silent and works like a charm. The missing rear seat head rests and magic seats on the top VX CVT trim is really disappointing. Still the love for Jazz mad me go ahead with it and own one. Mileage in city is around 10 to 11 kmpl as Jazz drinks fuel handsomely. However out on the highway it returns a decent 15 to 16 kmpl. I just did it"s second free service and it"s 3000 kms run on board. So far it"s good except the mileage in the city which could be a lil more. Overall I would give it 3.5/5. A good overall purchase.
Honda;Jazz20182020;24 Sep 2018;Laksh Gupta;1.0; Daily Commute ;I will suggest never buy a Honda car instead go for Baleno or any other car from different company never buy this car.. Tyres of new car just run 200kms are getting burst and company is least bothered. No customer service.. They just need money. Dakshin honda and honda cars india have cheated me. Very disappointed and will never ask anyone to be a prey of their trap. I cannot use my cars at high s peeds fearing tyre burst.. Very bad response and no solution for the customer. Received tyres with a buldge which will burst if driven fast. Very bad totally unacceptable
Honda;Jazz20182020;30 Aug 2018;Jatin Bhagat;2.0; Daily Commute ;Honda is the worst compared to Maruti and Hyundai. I have a maruti car and a hyundai car. My buying experience was thrashed with 6 months old car and 2 different purchase dates i.e. 31-March-2018 and 21-July-2018. When I bought the car on 21-July-2018. And, Honda still protecting its dealer and taking 15 days to respond. With Maruti and Hyundai, the customer is most important. With Honda, the cust omer is secondary. So, I would not recommend any honda car because of Honda car India customer service and customer centricity.
Honda;Jazz20182020;17 Dec 2019;Vinod Suthar;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I have been driving Jazz X since August 2012.

Now with cars like XUV300, Jazz seems to be too poor in terms of features as well as power.
Honda;Jazz20182020;16 Aug 2020;A S;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;4.5 overall rating for Jazz. Mileage and speed to be better, interiors can be improved further. My personal point of view, but saying this will also say that the car is very comfortable in all sense, spacious and truly a family car

Honda;Jazz20182020;23 May 2020;Prajwal J;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The best hatchback that I have ever owned. writing my personal experience being a passionate but not so sporty rider. Flashback : I would own Grand i10 ( 2013- 2016)- Comfortable best suspension systems, no noise cabin , Swift Zxi (2011 - 2013), superbly powered as it is named. other than this I had driven Figo which gave me a sense of comfortable driving ( in 2010). Now: After all above cars and with thorough review against all cars. I ended up hitting Jazz- V CVT. The reason behind this compact sedans are not my choice, and mid size segment were out of my budget. Let me tell you now this is one the best package available in India. The only thing I would miss in Jazz is 16" alloys. (others are fulfilled in later versions ans AVN, Cruse ctrl, button start etc). though , with 15" alloys the car gives smooth like butter driving experience on the highway and hassle free and j**k free drive in city & traffic. mileage maintenance etc are as normal as other brands available in India. my longest drive of ~ 2000KMs tour once a year and regular office commute of ~20KMs in this car has been fabulous so far. Verdict: If you are looking for a Daily Commute,Family Car, Tours with your family of 4. you shouldn't think of any other car than Jazz... Now new car buyers will get attractions viz., AVN, sunroof, cruse ctr, security locking etc. which we missed about 4year ago. so now it will be a fully loaded family package for you without any regrets in the segment.

Honda;Brio;25 Jul 2020;Siddh Shah;4.3; Occasional Commute ;1.2 L pure Japanese Engine literally brings life to the car and especially low weight which gives high torque and high speed. Because of low ground clearance, it is aerodynamically stable at very high speeds. Because of low center of gravity and very low turning radius, it is very easy to turn the car at sharp turns and at high speed without worrying that the car would topple or rollover. It has s moothest steering, smooth clutch pedals and gearbox too. Despite of being a small car, it has excellent leg space (greater than Baleno).
Honda;Brio;3 Dec 2018;Jigar Rana;5.0; Family Car ;I have Purchased the Honda Brio Automatic at 17/02/2018. First if you are the owner of Honda brio then you must change the driving Style of your Driving.

For a car of it's size, it provides good comfort and ample space for 4 average sized Indians. Honda's quality is amazing.

Honda;BRV;16 Feb 2020;Gopikrishna ..;5.0; Family Car | Tours;I am using honda top end model for.about 6 months its pretty good in performance and comfortness. Mileage is also not tht less as compared to other cars now adays in the market. Mileage on highways is 16 as tested by ARAI and in city 11 to 12. Mixed route traffic mileage i hav touched 13 mileage. CVT engines most reliable and good for engine performance. I dpnt hav any complaints as far as honda v ehicle brv is concerned.one shud go fr brv if 7 seater is reqd. Does not look heavy as other 7 seaters look but ample of luggage space is also avalable
Honda;BRV;11 Jul 2020;Jaideep Chitnis;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Have owned many sedans, the BRV is a MPV, but the engine experience, the smoothness, the maneuverability s almost like a Civic or City sedan. Its been 4 years owning and driving more than 100,000 kms. Thoroughly satisfied. Although, must state that I had to spend almost a 1.5 lakh extra in beefing up the console with a Blsupunct, hsnds free, DLRs, Stanley leather seats and leather steering wheel , better headlights, Michelin tyres etc.I shall rate it overall better than the Hyundai Greta, which I also own.
Honda;BRV;18 Nov 2020;Dhruv Gautam;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Awesome combination of comfort+power. It gives a good mileage and have a powerful engine. If you want to go for touring then this is the best car. I bought it just few months ago and got a great response from honda dealership from which i was impressed.

Honda;BRV;3 Sep 2018;Israr Mohi;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Me and my family has enjoyed every bit of a second in a brv it's so easy to drive in city traffics, on highway it pulls and have more than adequate performance for car that big I have seen 0-100 kmh in 10.11 seconds on my car which is petrol vtec engine, got a touchscreen optional from the dealer and it works fine,1on long journeys about 1200 km or more were never a trouble for our family of 8, an d car does keeps pulling and to its top speed and you won"t even feel your pushing the car it so refined, and when we don"t push the car to hard and doesn"t hit the vtec we got 16.5 kml and sometimes 16.9 kml on a manual transmission that is more than what Honda has stated
Honda;BRV;13 Jun 2019;Saurabh Singhal;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I have been driving BR-V since July 2016 and have been in love with it ever since! A very practical and versatile car it is with zero body roll on hilly terrain and excellent ground clearance makes every ditch easy. I choose this over XUV500, Scorpio and Innova (previous generation) and am glad about my decision. It offers great space like a full-size SUV, while comfort of a midsize sedan. Fuel ef ficiency in Diesel is superb. Overall, a great buy which most Indians have not appreciated simply because of its long design, which in practical use, perhaps helps the car to remain stable.
Honda;BRV;24 Mar 2019;Balaji Viswa..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I would say this as my excellent choice with respect to family car, performance, safety and still stylish too. I drove my BRV (my kids call it as ditto) on or within 2K rpm and to my surprise in highway, it gave me 18+ Kmpl. On an avg, my highway drive is 16-17Kmpl. Have experienced good even fully loaded condition and as well single. I LOVE it.. I feel only stuff that could have made even more ri ch would be the addition of features (especially cruise control, auto rain wipe, dash board and infotainment with better features)..
Honda;BRV;26 May 2019;Desmond Desouza;5.0; Family Car ;Its been 3 Year I have this car and its simply amazing.

Honda;Mobilio;30 Sep 2020;Riyazulislam..;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I own a 2014 Honda Mobilio I-Vtech. It is a great MPV for family use and is way better than Ertiga in terms of both safety and performance (petrol). I usually get the mileage of 16kmpl while driving and the maintenance cost is also not too much. I think that The Honda mobilio could have been a great success but it couldn't beat the Suzuki ertiga because of the trust of indians on Maruti Suzuki. I think, the money I've spent on buying the car, was worth. It did lack some features, but still is a great car for family use.

Toyota;Glanza;9 Jan 2021;Abhiraj Jit;4.3; Family Car;I have not owned the Toyota Glanza but had experienced this car through a test drive. Styling and comfort are great on the car and there are absolutely no complaints about the car. The seats of the car feel very wider and offers great comfort despite being a small car. Rear cabin does not feel claustrophobic which is appreciable. The build quality is something that can be better in order to justif y the Toyota badge as Toyota was safe and should remain safe. Interior quality is not very extraordinary and there are hard plastics. As a co-passenger, I noticed that the Chassis was light and there was a little bit bounciness which makes it feel being lighter. In terms of engine performance, the car did a great job due to less weight. According to my final verdict, I would say that this is better for short distances with families but not for highways or enthusiastic driving.
Toyota;Glanza;27 Nov 2020;Nitish Ramaraj;4.0; Daily Commute ;Toyota glanza more commonly known as the rebadged baleno.Well it's ok to get a baleno with the toyota support.A very comfortable car would never disappoint you.Performance is more than enough for daily city commute and occasional highway trips.Only downside is the mileage i get in city is not that great around 10 but on the highway i get 20.Other problems include the ground clearance problem some how i keep hitting it down to the speed breakers and yeah it's a pretty bad build quality, Just for a small crash the car gets damaged badly.Make a wise choice before getting this, Consider the other cars in the market now!🙂.
Toyota;Glanza;4 Oct 2020;Mohit Singh;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;The first question is why should you buy a glanza over a baleno then 1st. Cheaper (g hybrid and g variant ) 2nd lesser waiting period ,rest the car on its own is spacious, comfortable, fuel efficient, good for city runabout and the maintenance thanks to toyota e-60 service and app you get the exact amount you have to spend on the servicing of the car Tried to keep it short and simple hope should h elp
Toyota;Glanza;24 Jan 2021;Anand Hariharan;2.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;First time Toyota customer. The buying process was really good from Amana Toyota. The car is good with respect to space, comfort. The biggest pain in CVT is very low mileage in both city and highway. I get 8kmpl in city and 12kmpl in highway however carefully I drive. Got to check with Toyota in the 2nd service since I have clocked 5000kms now. Hope the issue gets sorted.
Toyota;Glanza;5 Dec 2020;Senthil Nathan;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Very good car far better than Altroz performance, but when coming to build quality it's 2 step below than Altroz. -Altroz saftey car with awesome build quality-Glanza stylish Fun to drive car with decent build quality.

Toyota;Yaris;6 Mar 2019;RAJESH S;3.0; Family Car ;Yaris is a family car, if you are giving priority to safety and comfort. As my last 8 months experience, safety and comfort is the positive things in Yaris. But this is an over priced car (For V-CVT variant, should pay about 15 Lakhs) and also it does not have any good features (Eg - Very Bad Infotainment System), So don"t go for a higher variant of this car, instead buy a lower variant and add ad ditional features whatever you need,Since this car have 7 Airbag and ABS included in all its variants. Regarding the mileage for Normal driving you will get 12 to 13 and in Traffic, it should be about 9 to 10.
Toyota;Yaris;1 Jul 2020;Rajesh Sahoo;4.7; Daily Commute ;My experience in this car is very good specially the riding comfort, suspension, turning radius is excellent. Look wise I like it than the other cars in same range. Regarding mileage with 1.5 L Gasoline engine I would say its performance is very good. I am getting between 13 to 14 in city drive. Overall I like it very much.
Toyota;Yaris;31 Oct 2018;Sls Babu;3.7; Daily Commute ;Yaris is great all round car but over pricing just killed it. Decent design inspired from Lexus at the front and Corolla at the back . Tyre size could have been 16 inch for v or vx variants ( they had given 185/60R15 for all variants , which is the default size of B segment ) . It looks like , they took out Etios engine, add more power , add more air bags and renamed with Yaris with astronomical p ricing. Interior space is decent . Ride and handling is also nice . Overall , except for J variants , other variants are simply over priced
Toyota;Yaris;14 Dec 2020;RAJESHWARI T..;2.7; Daily Commute ;Overall car is good well maintained & only major issue is mileage part which is too poor 8-9 that's all on highways it's a total fake promises by such a huge brand toyota kiroskar motors.Pls suggest how to increase the mileage 3rd service is upp.
Toyota;Yaris;19 Jan 2021;Debendra Dash;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Good car for long drive. Excellent driving comfort. Mileage within city limits are little less. However, overall its a good heavy sedan with large boot space.
Toyota;Yaris;10 Feb 2019;Sol Rudolf;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Amazing car. Ignore the reviewers, Indian buyers have been had again by the biased reviewers.The extra price over the competition doesnt matter as this a car you can keep for 10 years. Car is great for daily commutes, Toyota has tuned it for mileage but you can race if you drop a gear. Best in class build quality and suspension and ride quality and the most important - safety with 7 airbags in the only sedan costing 10.5 lakhs.
Toyota;Yaris;13 May 2019;Rahul Nair;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Yaris is carefully engineered for indian road conditions. Excellent ride quality and suspension. Performance is mediocre as you won"t feel the punch on initial gears. Higher gears are awesome..Overall i would say best car for family ride and touring

Toyota;InnovaCrysta20162020;14 Nov 2020;Mr. india;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Crysta.It is too damn expensive but i liked it.Travelled in 2.4gx and 2.4zx.It feels so comfortable except for 3rd row seats which pains for adult.It is okay but not good, Replace the middle row head rest with smaller headrest(in height, Used in older innovas, Aftermarket ) so it gives a better view of front rather than just seeing the back of the headrest entire journey for those sitting in 3rd r ow seat.Its brakes are very effective and runs like a leopard on highways on power mode.It's so comfortable sometimes it made me feel lazy in it.It's a bit of a task to drive it in cities but there's a solution, Many people have fit external mirrors on the left end part on the good of crysta, Some have even fit those on both ends, Which gave a clear view and a lot better judgement than before and since then it's easy to drive in cities.Car drives very smoothly and less claustrophobic as compared to ertiga and innova (discontinued model) and xuv500.Mileage got on 2.4 variants is 14 sometimes 13.5 kmpl on highways and in city it gave around 11.Crysta has a better ground clearance than innova.Just because of its soft suspensions it's not advisable to drive roughly on broken roads unlike scorpio or bolero or qualis or tavera or old innova.For rough usage you need to harden it's suspensions.Thats my experience on crysta.:-d.
Toyota;InnovaCrysta20162020;18 Jun 2019;Mathew Joseph;1.3; Family Car ;While running back to Trivandrum from Velankanni, on 2-6-19 morning the right rear tyre blast on East cost high way which is a very smooth and clean road. The tyre is 16" Apollo make. My vehicle has completed below 8000 km and purchased in July 2017. At the time of purchase I have pointed out the tyre blast issue of Crysta and the company people told that it was because of 17" tyre and they have m odified the same with 16" and the issue was resolved. However, Crysta is still showing the tyre blast problem. The tyre was with correct air pressure and looks like new. The road was very clean and the driving speed was 100-110km/ hr. I am very much convinced that it was not because of any external factors like stone, nail, rough road etc. The company service people inspected the tyre and sent the photos to Apollo's opinion. Now Apollo says a diplomatic answer that it is happened due to the running with low tyre pressure ! I am a Scientist Engineer1working in ISRO Trivandrum. Still, the blasted tyre is with Toyota and waiting for their decision.
Toyota;InnovaCrysta20162020;9 Nov 2018;Vidit Chhabra;1.0; Family Car;I bought Toyota Innova Crysta 2.8G On 20 August 2018 from Globe Toyota Kaithal (HR) after ten days a new model of Innova was launched and discontinued that model which is given to me. Innova which is given to me is absolete within 10days. And as we know old models are sold to customers on discounted prices but globe Toyota Kaithal did a fraud with me they sold me old model at full prices .Today I went to globe Toyota at 12 30 pm all the staff members were there I talked about my problems the manager Sushil Kumar told me come to me 4 pm I said ok I went there and he didn’t gave me response and he even dint listen to my problem he misbehaved with me . These people are so pathetic in fact I think they are not educated they don’t know how to talk to their Consumer. I am so surprised to see people who are running Toyota’s agency.

Toyota;InnovaCrysta20162020;3 Jun 2019;Aayush Bhingare;4.7; Daily Commute ;unlike the older Vehicles , Crysta ownership has been far from hassle free. That doesn"t mean its a bad car, it"s fun to drive and the engine is zippy. There are some niggles and the parts are a little on the expensive side. Eg; The tires are expensive - one costs about 10-11k , also Toyota could have added more features like LED brake lamps,auto dimming IRVM, Rain sensing wipers, 360 deg camera ( available as an 24,000/- option). over all a great car. Safety is 1st as it has 7 Airbags, ABS, EBD, brake assist, ESP, traction control, Hill hold assist. Brakes do a fabulous job of stopping the 1.8 ton vehicle.
Toyota;InnovaCrysta20162020;14 Nov 2018;Moorthy Raman;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;The Interior of the car should have been little better than what is existed. Basically the armrest is poorly designed and styled and not giving your arms to rest while travelling . not well designed and the entire doors were should have been built solid and well finished . It just looks plastically.Rear seat cupholders are very cheap plastic and tend to break at any point when you place a full bot tle of liquid .Even after paying 2.1 Million INR ,there isn"t even have a digital fuel meter, just the conventional needle type gauge .

Toyota;EtiosLiva;30 Sep 2020;Surajsinhaa ..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car;this has been one of the most reliable and comfortable hatchback I have drove in my family. It has never let us down , no matter what. maintenance is next to nil. the only drawback has been it's mileage. Had I baught a diesel motor I would have never parted or thaught of parting by this beauty. I am thinking of letting this go after it has been with the family for 4 years and 45k kilometres. it st ill looks the same as brand new. The colours are well and truly intact as it was when I baught it 4 years back.
Toyota;EtiosLiva;15 Sep 2020;Javeed Chesti;3.7; Occasional Commute ;My Toyota Etios Liva performance, mileage comfortable, everything is good I love my Toyota Etios Liva if Toyota will not stop making Etios my plan was to buy 2 Etios Cross and Liva with digital instruments cluster, leather seats, Automatic gear box, split seats etc, like one in Brazil Toyota I love Toyota in future I will buy a Toyota Landcruiser first generation Prado type ll
Toyota;EtiosLiva;16 Oct 2020;Ethan Fernandes;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Styling of this car is really well done. Performance is good, because of the light weight. 170 Nm of torque(diesel) it feels peppy. Very spacious, can sit 3 people easily at the back seat. Downsides are very less features and alot of hard plastics and cost cutting materials in cabin. Cabin insulation is average and Engine note is lovely.
Toyota;EtiosLiva;8 Aug 2018;Sumit Dnyanesh;3.7; Daily Commute ;First gear and second gear pickup could be improved. Probably something like SOHC configuration which helps lower end torque. Upper body and bonnet and door material(finishing) is very ordinary because outside noise is noticeable including engine noise. Distance to empty is must to have feature in petrol cars at least. Safety is at its best along with seating arrangements. Interiors looks above av erage. Servicing in Toyota is no doubt much better than any other brand. Headlight is single beam but does its job in city area (on highway one will need fog lamps or HIDs). Cars sound in cabin is considerably higher than other petrol cars in India.
Toyota;EtiosLiva;18 Apr 2020;Praveen Bala;4.3; Family Car ;it is one of the best hatchback ... although some may find it's interior bland but it's a matter of choice that you want a safe and reliable car or just show off ...

Toyota;EtiosLiva;1 Nov 2018;Gulshan Dagar;4.7; Family Car ;I am driving Etios Liva VXD last six months. Continuously I have drive this car upto 800 km non stop with any average speed of 60-70 kmph. No issue faced. car is most stable on road and quick response of engine. Comfert level is quite good. Value for money car.& it is best car for small famlies. Truly said go for it. As compare to Maruti swift its far batter in build quality. But Maruti gives more features. as per me this car need some up gradation i mean to say that there should be more features in it.

Toyota;Innova;16 Dec 2020;Anand Tom;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;The 2013 innova 2.5v is a real joy to drive.Despite its simpleton mpv looks it's an absolute fun to drive this on the roads.Be it long stretches or sharp bendy corners or hairpins the innova will take on em like a boss.The drive of the vehicle is what i really enjoy the momment you are in the driver seat and turn the keys and fire up the engine 2.5l turbo diesel comes to life with a heavy rumble a nd bass.And if you are diesel head you will really enjoy this part especially.As you stick into the 1st gear and let the clutch loose the transmission of power is just instantaneous and linear and yet there is subtle balance in its delivery she just takes off into the road.Initially whenever i drove the innova i felt the lack of power.But it was due to my inexperienced and immature drive style that caused this.And the more i drove it.I understood the engine better.And rather driving it like a petrol engine i drove the way a diesel engine should be driven.And that is by giving enough and more revs while attaining the right speeds to shift.Also you needn't always be at a higher gear while driving this.Its all about keeping the mechanicals in their sweet spot and if you keep the engine in its sweet spots which are the bottom and mid ends the innova really becomes an amazing machine to drive.The steering is really precise and gives enough information as well.Although i find slightly more on the heavier side and also a bit of hassle in manoeuvring in tight sity spaces.But it is possible to take this car anywhere due to its streamlined body.Also this being a rear wheel drive makes the innova that much fun to drive as well.The drive of the innova is so good that it has enough acceleration in the 5th gear to keep moving forward in the highways, You can do a 1000km journey without a break on the innova.Infact it can still hold off against modern cars in terms of performance and can outlast most of the vehicle sold in todays market.Its a lot better than owning a south korean tin can that has so many fancy features and no real drive.

Mahindra;Thar;3 Oct 2020;Md;3.7; Daily Commute ;Overhyped, and Overpriced. Pros:1. Design - An eye-catching boxy look, kind of mini wrangler2. 18inch allow wheels with better ground clearance. I am expecting to change the lane by driving over the road dividers in case the U-turn is more than 1km ;)3. As the city streets are no different than off-road streets these days with millions of potholes here and there, Thar serves the purpose of my dail y off-roading dreams ;)4. Good for a small family or use it as a second car5. Thar would definitely get you a girl if you don’t have one ;)Cons:1. Overpriced: Either M&M didn’t conduct price sensitivity testing among the potential buyers to identify the right pricing model, or they assumed that they are going to sell limited units, so why not at a premium cost? Those who wanna buy will buy anyhow.2. M&M isn’t aware of the new segment apart from those who buy Thar for off-road only - Regular office goers who want to use Thar as their daily car or a second car for a family outing during the weekends3. So many loose wires here such as the glass defrost at the back 4. There is no boot space officially. Even Tata Nano had better boot spaceConclusions:1. Eventually the buyers would curse Thar designers when they are over with the looks of Thar and start facing the real issues2. Bring down the cost of LX MT 4 seater to 12 lakh on-road. Don’t make the buyer considering better alternatives available after 15lk such as Nexon, Harrier, Hector, Seltos, and so forth.
Mahindra;Thar;5 Oct 2020;Angad Sharma;3.0; Daily Commute;M&M had lost it petrol version is too expensive in 2021 Suzuki will launch Jimmy possibly in 3 door and 5 door they should have utilised space on back properly in 4 seater as space near seats is useless no led lights in 2020 that's wierd diesel cannot say anything but petrol is punchy and usable sou d dampning in Bonet or any other parts that's wierd cost cutting glove box is of no use and I'm har dtop version they should have improved interior fittings

Mahindra;Scorpio;12 Jan 2020;Hemant Kumar;4.0; Occasional Commute ;I have been using scorpio s10 4wd since 2017nov, and the first thing i've noticed in this beast that door's noise keeps you irritate,it won't going to stop not even in agency, and you will have to use to it, and second thing I've noticed that i got a milage of 7 km per litre in hills and 12 - 13 km per litre in long drive, seats are like you will have to compromise with them, and no storage in thi s suv, like there are only 2 bottle space at rear doors and only 1 bottle space in front on gear console, there are no storage in front doors, can't even place your smart phone or wallet anywhere properly, and this suv comes with the cheapest quality 17inches MRF tyres that is going to run only 20,000kms, but instead on these cons this suvs performance is really good, and the 4wd feature is so amazing, trust me if you love off-roading then this suv will makes you fall in love with this beast...but mahindra need to work alot on the features,storage and comfort, at last i will just say that instead of so much cons i still love this beast.

Mahindra;Scorpio;12 Sep 2020;Mr;3.7; Tours | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;The performance of this car is obviously good, but the lock down started within 5 days from the date of my purchasing of this car, I have not used it much, for sharing my experience, But my concern is that I have purchased a S9 variant, Your website and all other leading sites are saying that S9 variant has a Navigation system inbuilt, But I am not being able to find this in my Car, even my dealer also saying that It does not comes with S9 variant, I would like to ask the writer of this article, that from where you have got this information that S9 has a Navigation system in it, If the reviewer has seen any of the S9 with a Navigation system, please let me know that, Please let me know that how to install the navigation system in S9 variant, even after purchasing the vehicle, Regards, Sanjit Saha, Siliguri, West Bengal.
Mahindra;Scorpio;14 Nov 2020;Mr. india;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;We used it for many years but sold it. Its pickup made the drive fun. It reaches the full 180 kmph mark on highways, that’s kinda impressive but It’s brakes were not powerful though on a car like Scorpio. It’s cruising speed was usually 80-90 kmph bcoz of its low mileage .Mileage on highways was 11.5 kmpl and city mileage was 9 kmpl. It was very spacious and airy. It was a bouncy car. It had low maintenance and easy to repair car. Resale value was decent but not that great as there were many more models in Scorpio which were eating each other’s resale value (people preferred m2di or vlx model rather than 2.6 turbo) Miss that car though. U ll love it if u drive it :-)
Mahindra;Scorpio;6 Mar 2020;Ashutosh Shukla;3.3; Daily Commute ;scorpio has great road presence and it feels like king of the road while driving . I got captain seat version but the space was always issue.. if you have more than two bahas it has be 4 seater only and if we were 5 then no luggage space.. one more area it was bot so good was driving ergonomics got my elbow hurt many times by door.. spending 15 lacs on it was bot a great decision but got very good resale value.so no regret..miss that king feeling.

Bad thing is Tyre wear and tear is more.best things is the driving comfort and wide vision and will not put you in trouble.Mileage is very poor, car pick up is very poor, Build quality to be improved a lot.vibration comparatively less, in my model features are very less.After sale service is very bad.
Mahindra;Scorpio;16 Oct 2020;Nikhil Franco;3.0; Occasional Commute ;Putting my foot on the throttle always brings smile on my face.The pickup of the car is phenomenal.The drawbacks to it are the tough steering.You can get a workout out of driving the scorpio even though it has power steering.Also the after sales service is pathetic in goa.Sad that a well built car cannot get the service it deserves.
Mahindra;Scorpio;2 Jan 2020;Shashanka Ch..;3.3; Family Car | Tours;I have waxed eloquently about my experience with the car on my posts in your forum and i feel that I need not continue over & over again!Enough to say that, despite its shortcomings, the Scorpio lived up to its reputation as a highly competent SUV, with huge street cred, and an enviable reputation in the motoring community.
Mahindra;Scorpio;3 Jul 2020;Sankalp Singh;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Trustworthy beast that has stood the test of time and never let me down.

Plus it looks badass.

Mahindra;Scorpio;3 Jan 2019;Amrith Nambiar;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;It is a wonderful car to drive but lacks on comfort and is a bit too scary to drive on corners and it also lacks high end punch. In city driving the performance is awesome. Ergonomics is not the best. Space is plentiful. The suspension is very bad and is very jumpy even though an aftermarket suspension will fix the problem they are expensive. Overall quality is not the best even though it is somet hing you will not notice given the USA of the car

It gives 20kmpl as company says and it is not bad and safety features you know about by broucher of vehicles and it's company website, Boot space is less if you take so much luggage but if you are not taking so much luggage so you have enough space and rear passenger seat have so good space even if from seats are moved back till it slide rear passenger can comfortably seat.overall it is good. Once driving is something strange happen mileage is showing 22kmpl.

Mahindra;Bolero;16 Apr 2020;Abhinav bhagat;3.7; Daily Commute | Tours;Bolero is a true SUV in every sense. can accommodate more than 7 people, is big & have a lot of space. Works brilliantly on almost every terrain.Ride quality is good, build quality is good. Easy to maintain, although mileage is on the lower side but for a SUV like bolero this could be neglected. Mahindra could yet work on its interior looks & making a bit more comfortable an amazing car in its seg ment.
Mahindra;Bolero;10 Sep 2020;Rajat Bijur;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;Contrary to what I heard, its a great car to own for out of town visits especially rural areas with bad roads. The seating position and stock headlamps are quite good even for night driving. Its turning radius is a little big but given its usage it is acceptable. From point of view of comfort, I have yet to drive a real long trip yet but the sub 100 kms have been a breeze.

Mahindra;Marazzo;24 Dec 2018;Anjan J;5.0; Tours | Family Car ;After lots of speculation and apprehension finally we bought our 2nd family car, A marazzo M8. After driving 1000 km in the first week ; now i share my view on this car. My requirement was a 7 seater good car in a decent price . Innova is good, but was out of budget for me. I had to decide among Ertiga, Lodgy, marazzo, BRV and lower variant of Hexa. Marazzo was chosen after a lot of R & R . It pro ved to be Superb sedan comfort in a MPV at a reasonable price. The ride quality is really very good. Driving is superb , easy steering, light pedals,easy visibility. Gear Transmission is smooth and braking response is very gently precise. I did not have to worry for the path holes or speed breaker , because suspension is the best in class I have ever driven.Regarding engine power: it generated so much power that it glided my fully loaded(7 adults) ahead of crystas ,XUV 500 etc on the highway. Look is definitely a personal choice. But with practicability of cornering lights,infotainment screen, good supporting seats... I will say Marazzo gave me the best value of my hard earn money.I am impressed with this crafted piece of good automobile engineering.Experience after 8 months(19000km): my experience and view remains same about Marazzo. Each time I drive this car , m actually impressed with the responsiveness of this car. After completing many family outings with this companion, I can say that I purchased a great value car.
Mahindra;Marazzo;11 Aug 2020;Soham Kulkarni;5.0; Family Car ;It's a great and one of the most refined car by Mahindra, as it have many luxurious features and material quality in a good value as compare to others.. Marazzo have developed on ladder framework, It also looks much bigger, more muscular, more stylish, more powerful and the mpv promising features which are also beautifully packed in this car such as It is more specious, comfortable and fuel effici ent car...I think its a best car between ertiga and innova which has both mpv as well as suv features which makes it excellent package by Mahindra
Mahindra;Marazzo;19 Jan 2021;Chayan Banerjee;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;I purchased Marrazzo M8 as an upgrade from a 5 seater car. Below is the categorized feedback after driving 30k . ProsPerfomance 1. Very smooth2. Has economy mode that improves mileage3. Great pickup4. Good brakingComfort1. Quiet cabin 2. Comfortable seating even in the 3rd row.3. Great Rear AC4. Automatic Climate control 5. Tall seating 6. Light steering and easy to handleConsComfort 1. Slight bod y roll (which 5 seaters usually don't have)
Mahindra;Marazzo;15 Aug 2020;Deepak Thakur;4.3; Tours | Family Car ;Best family car in this price and more spacious than Innova crysta . The mileage is 17kmpl on highway and 13kmpl in hilly areas. The things which should be improve , Ground clearance is good from the middle and back but ground clearance is too low from the front side . The front bumper hits very easily on small bumps .Engine is not so powerful ,at least 2000cc should be given
Mahindra;Marazzo;12 Mar 2019;Imdad Ahmed;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Marazzo is a beautifully crafted car keeping in mind the quality of ride for the passengers .The ride quality is too good and as far the cabin noise is considered its far better than petrol cars. Having a diesel engine under its hood and having a quite cabin is a perfectly match of refined engine and good insulation..On the mileage front without AC with an average speed of 70Km-80km one can easily churn out 20KM/L whereas with full AC on one can easily get between 18 -18.5 KM/L. In city the mileage drops to a decent 16Km/l to 17km/l with AC. In a whole Mahindra Marazzo is an excellent package of features bundled together. After a long time mahindra has put a perfectly balanced MPV in the market
Mahindra;Marazzo;22 Oct 2020;Anoop Anilkumar;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car;this car is the best thing that has happened to me the mileage of the car is phenomenal I get close to 16 plus no matter how I drive the last long drive I did was to Goa from Cochin and the comfort was awesome no one in my family felt any fatigue I was the only driver and I enjoyed every bit of the ride. a very happy customer indeed.

Mahindra;TUV300Plus;1 May 2019;Prabhu Patel;4.0; Daily Commute ;Chose this instead of the popular Bolero. Was looking at a 9 seater with a little more finesse. On the upside it has the full Scorpio 2.2 MHawk engine. Very decent looks. The 9 seater actually looks far better than the 7 seaters imho. Suspension is hard and better for greater loads. This is a great vehicle for tour and travel operators. Overall Value for money. On the downside it lacks comfort and refinement - as say compared to a Creta. But then at that price it"s 👍.

Mahindra;BoleroPowerPlus;20 Dec 2018;Jebin Abraham;2.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Good looks from outside. Interior is old fashioned. Brakes are very bad. Parking in sloped surfaces could cause vehicle to roll. No braking confidence while driving. Midrow is unfoldable so can't load a lot of items.A small hatchback with seats folded can fit more stuff than bolero. Large turning radius very disadvantageous in cities. I would say spend little more n buy a good suv or muv than this .

Mahindra;e2oPlus;3 Apr 2019;Nr Sridhara;5.0; Daily Commute;very economical just 75 paise per KM. I commute around 70 kms everyday. I just spend less than rs. 70 per day. zero maintenance cost. with petrol car I have to spend more than rs. 500 per day. I purchased this car for 7 lakhs. petrol car with same features like power steering auto gear cost nearly the same for ex. maruti celerio. After 5 years petrol car will sell at 2 lakhs or less. Assume that t his car price also would be the same. But with electric car I would have saved a petrol bill of 6 lakhs plus. car waranty including battery is for 3 years and I spent just 27000/- for additional 2 years warranty. so no fear of huge maintenance cost for 5 years. with all this is great economy and silent driving is superb. Car can be controlled precisely and it has features like hill hold and creepy features which helps to manage car with ease in bumper to bumper traffic. Excellent car .

The suspension setup is too soft I have to drive fast on bumpy road but it will not inform you that your car went from a bump or breaker.I am owing Hyundai Verna 2019 sx(o) variant but the comfort level is next level if I compare with Verna.2019 Verna can not give you that comfort which Verito has given in 2012 models.But It has also some concern because Every car has something to think.It has some rattling sound from cabin, The power feels little bit low but If you down shift It would be powerful.I am happy with this very less maintenance the cost of parts is very cheap but the mechanic has to work more on this car by which mechanic can be frustrated. The last and most important feature of this car is Mileage It gives me something 30kmpl on regular base One time It gave me the highest average of 34 kmpl without A/C.It gives you 28-30kmpl with A/C so this car will make you always happy:)

As we use it a Coorg its a beast made for the roads and off road capabilities there. Maintenance is nothing much. Proper riding, proper fuel,oil and air to be maintained and it will run well with no much issues. Haven't used 4/4 till now, but till now we never regretted that we bought this vehicle. Absolu te Gem on road to drive. Thanks Mahindra.

Tata;Altroz;7 Feb 2020;Agnel Ajay;4.7; Occasional Commute ;Tata Altroz, The Gold Standard...Tata Altroz is the company's first venture in premium hatchback segment. This is safer and packed with features let's explore Ththis Gold Standard Car....×Design The design of the Tata Altroz doesnot resemble any car till now. Th e looks are given as a part of 'Impact 2.0' that is the design language followed by Tata Motors. From front the position of the fog lamp s are seen a little above the regular placement. Even though the car gets projector headlights, they are not LEDs. The tripod stand like grill slots look appealing. This design is followed somewhere also.From the side we have certain elements to note. The piano black finish for the ORVMs and the positioning of turn indicators to the body are some of them. The rear door handle also have been moved to the C pillar. The 16 inch alloys looks well proportionate to the car.Towards the back side we can see the blacked taillights. Like I said above the rear end is also distinct with its cutting edges.Getting in is not a task at all. The doors open widely at 90° making it even easy for older people.The interior have a floating touch screen infotainment panel surrounded by an ambient light setup. Automatic AC controls below it and certain ports like the USB& AUX ports.The car have a semi-digital instrument cluster. Analog speedometer & digital tachometer and other informations. The seats are supportive and offer a good support. They also have a tripod base shaped arrangements on them. Both the front and rear seats have rear armrests. Also like the i20, this car also have rear AC vents. The boot is practical to have luggages for a family trip. You can also flip the back row seats fully to expand the luggage area. No 60:40 splitting is possible.×Driving and comfortThe car is powered by a 1.2 liter revotron petrol engine and a 1.5 liter revotorq diesel engine both are BS6 complaintand are mated to a 5 speed manual gear box no automatic till now but will be released in coming dates.The petrol motor gives 85hp and 113 nm, its a three cylinder engine. But despite being a 3 cylinder mill, the engine is punchy enough to pull the car due to its light weight This motor is seen in the nexon also. The diesel motor is a 4 cylinder one seen in the nexon. But it is detuned to 89hp and 200 nm this is the kingmaker 'the gold standard' as said by Tata. This is a punchy motor since the torque output is got from a very low RPM, this is peppy enough and enthusiastic to drive. On my drive I got a mileage of 16-18 kmpl for diesel.Both these engines have two driving options City& Eco. No sports mode, don't know why Tata avoided it. The mode selector is seen behind the gear lever. This mode. hanges the theme from blue to green.Top trim also gets cruise control setup.The suspension is good enough but you can feel the comfort when you glide over a pathole. Brilliant work by Tata engineers.×InfotainmentThe car is packed with Harman's 6 speaker system.The floating touch screen is easy to use compared to previous Tata cars. The sound quality is brilliant and is class leading. You can customize the theme colour as your wish.×Variants Altroz is available from base xe, xm, xt, xz& xz(o) . The car also packs with various options that includes factory fitted customisations they are Rhythm,Style,Luxe& Urban. These options are available on various levels.×Safety Tata means safety this car scored 5 stars in global NCAP being the second Indian car to scor it and the first car in its segment to score so. The company packs the car with 2 airbags ABS& EBD as standard. ×For whom is this car???If you want your family to travel in comfort& safe. Then you can choose this car. If you are an enthusiastic driver and all you need is a diesel hatchback then you may go for this car. Because this is the only car in its segment to offer a BS-6 complaint diesel engine.×Comparing with competitorsMaruti Baleno, Hyundai Elite i20, Honda Jazz, VW Polo are the main competetors.Comparing with them we see that Altroz is stronger than Baleno and its diesel engine is excellent, but coming to petrol baleno scores the more.The i20 is the feature rich car here it also have Hyundai's reliability and offers a 6th gear that its rivals misses. The 1.4litre CRDI diesel and 1.2litre petrol engines are also appreciable. Honda Jazz may be the car with lower specs. But the magic that honda does with its petrol mill is something that none can match with.VW Polo is the synonym of sportiness inthis segment its diesel engine having a nice performance too. But taking care of a VW car is a bit tasky. ×VerdictThe Tata Altroz is a car that a common man can buy it is sufficiently powerfull (diesei motor), and the best in safety. It also offers segment first features like floating screen& ambient lighting
Tata;Altroz;31 Oct 2020;Ismayil M;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Completed 7500 kms in my altroz petrol xz. the only problem i found is with the engine because it is a3 cylinder, need to rev almost to 3000 rpm for the vehicle to accelerate in city mode, in eco mode power is reduced by 10 percent which makes it more laggy. but the comfort is unbeatable, corner stability is top notch, steering is light at low speed and gets hard in high speed which makes it more easy to control and very precise. music system is the best in class(harman kardin audio) and mood light makes it fell like a luxury car at night. the high beam height cannot be adjusted but it gives a very long throw so it is reasonable,lowbeam is projector and bright enough. im 6ft tall i can sit comfortably both in driving and backseat and it has more space compared to its rivals. brakes are crisp comes with abs nd ebd and makes it stable while driving. overall im really satisfied with the car and no others can beat it at this segment
Tata;Altroz;27 Jul 2020;Murali Dhara;2.7; Family Car ;Please don't go for TATA product. I have purchased altroz XM model, this doesn't come with remote key which is one of basic feature required to the cars. While booking we were given false assurance by Tata delealer that this car comes with remote key. Now if we go for aftermarket remote key product, car warrenty will lapse so, I am waiting for Tata accessories but not sure how long it takes. Regar ding this I contacted Tata company and dealer, they are not sure when they will release this accecery. Also, now my car completed only 90kms and it started giving jerky motion (intermittently) in 2nd gear. Problem with brand new car!!!I purchased this car/brand to support make in India product but now I realized that I wasted my hard earned money.Guys think twice before investing your hard earned money on this brand.
Tata;Altroz;9 Sep 2020;Balakishan G..;5.0; Family Car ;Having owned the vehicle for last one month and after driving it for 1000 km, I can say I am delighted by this car. It always put a smile on my face. I am getting mileage of more than 20 on highways when I switch on eco mode with cruise control. Overall I have got mileage of 16 so far which is a very good mileage for a petrol car.I think its a really Gold Standard as its being advertised.Its not y et perfect though, the car is a bit lazy in first and second gears which is expected for a naturally aspirated engine. Some revving will be required to overcome the shortage of torque. If somebody is not aware this or want better low-end torque, better to go for the diesel variant or wait for the turbo variant.
Tata;Altroz;18 Nov 2020;Neeraj Mehra;5.0; Family Car ;After 1.5 month of research and analysis i found altroz among premium hatchback segment (i20, Baleno).I wanted a car with safety style comfort mileage road presence feature preferably.And tata altroz filled my requirement.Engine performance is also good it takes 2, 3 second more to getup to 100 than i20 and baleno because of its heavy weight of material.But which is not merely mensionable.I am tot ally satisfied.If you are already a hardcore tata hater then you will not find it as worth car.But if you believe in product then definitely you should buy.U will never regret after purchase.
Tata;Altroz;13 Feb 2020;Viraj Dave;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Everything till now feels amazing. only one area where i cannot say the same is for the petrol engine. I've done just 500km till now. so haven't yet pushed the car (waiting to get past 1500km mark) hopefully it turns out to be a fun to drive engine. handling is on par with ford on this altroz so i really hope the engine compliments the handling once i start pushing it. average is around 14 ( shown in MID).interiors are really premium. the design,the feel (especially the steering wheel) the exterior design everything looks and feels amazing and really well put together.

The interior is equiped with all the features which you will expect in the higher end cars. The build quality is great, even you feel in door closing thouf sound. The sound system is amazing.The AC works great. In low and middle end, the performance is linear which is good f or these range. Overall I'm very much satisfied with Altroz.
Tata;Altroz;2 Feb 2020;Manas Yadav;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;best tata car ever i ride and handling is a excellent the performance in road and stability when you drive 120 above is superb and premium look and feel inside and outside
Tata;Harrier;10 Apr 2019;Nishanth Ch;5.0; Tours | Family Car ;I have been waiting for this car since AutoExpo 2018. And I have become the 75th customer in entire country (and obviously in entire world) to buy this vehicle.But I have made inquiries into other cars in this segment. That is the competitors of Harrier. They are Jeep Compass and XUV 500. I have removed Hyundai Tucson from this list as it is heavily priced for the performance and features it provi des. First I have eliminated XUV500. The car is extremely spacious and extremely light to handle easily. But I did not like 1. The looks of XUV500 W11, both exterior and interior compared to Harrier or Compass.2. Sound system is pretty ordinary too, compared to Compass and Harrier.3. The horse power is bit higher for XUV500 compared to Harrier (comes into play after a speed of 120kmph - which I have no intentions of crossing on Indian road conditions). 4. And it has got sunroof (which is awkwardly placed between the front and rear seats inaccessible to either row). 5. And it has got disc brakes for all wheels (which is not a necessity to me, until the braking does the sudden halts for me efficiently).Then I have had tough time to eliminate Jeep Compass. Because the built and looks of Compass are exceptionally great. The quality reminded me of Benz, BMW premium cars in terms of drive quality, NVH levels in cabin, suspension, heavy and safe feeling inside the car. Overall there are lots of premium touches for Compass.The reasons for eliminating Compass are:1. The base variant Compass Sport on road price is 20.5 lakhs - the same price as top variant of Harrier XZ. 2. The safety features provided in Harrier like ESP, Corner stability, Roll over mitigation control, 6 air bags are provide in compass starting from Compass Limited 4x4 edition which is priced at 27 lakhs on road.3. Even if I go with Compass Sport, basic requirements like good leather seats, reverse parking camera, reverse parking sensors, fog lamps, projector headlamps etc should be bought as additional accessories - despite shelling 20.5 lakhs.4. Space of Compass is enough for 5 people, but the rear seats are uncomfortably vertical, causing pains and cramps in abdomen for a bit fat people on long drives.So I bought Harrier XZ and got it delivered on Feb 10th 2019 and roamed more than 5000 kms till date. The following are pros and cons I have observed.Pros:1. The turning radius is very good. 2. The hydraulic steering gives wonderful control on the car. Even at low speeds, the steering is not heavy.3. Very comfortable seats even for a huge person. For long drives these are very apt.4. Excellent infotainment system. Sound system is extraordinary. The touch panel is very responsive and feather touch. Android Autoplay works brilliantly. The dashboard just behind steering is very helpful to check distance to empty, mileage the car is returning.5. Air conditioning for both front and rear is brilliant.6. Braking is excellent and adequate even in high speeds (though rear brakes are drum cylinder brakes). Had an unfortunate chance of testing Corner stability Program. A sudden turn by a biker on highway made me steer hard right. CSP immediatley kicked in and safely did the turn in opposite direction and turned me on to highway after crossing the obstacle.7. ESP programs all are efficient and highly useful. Because of the drive modes, I have an experience of driving 3 different cars as economy mode converts the car engine power to 110 PS, city mode to 125 PS and Sport mode to 140 PS.8. Enormous boot space - I have literally packed my family"s (consists of 5 adults) entire clothes packed into the boot. Nothing more to say.Cons:1. Front view of the car is bit dull and not so eye catching. The tata logo doesn"t help much either to cotradict. The car catches eye only when the side or back of the car comes into view.2. The right side ORVM clubbed with the A pillar creates a huge blindspot. Twice I almost had an accident, and once I gave a slight nudge to a scooterist.3. The Xenon HID projector headlamps are very bright, but when faced with beam lights of opposite vehicles, some blindspots are created. Need extra LED lights to be installed if you are regular in driving on highways, which don"t cover opposite vehicle beam lights.Overall Performance:The handling of the car in any road conditions is excellent in this price range. Whether it be braking, suspension or steering control, everything is exceptional about this car. Talk about comfort, and there is no better seating than Harrier (except of middle person in rear seat). The pickup of the car is magnificent in sport mode. Not so exciting in other driving modes. And coming to mileage, I have travelled from Vijayawada to Tirupati a distance of 450 kms and it cost me 30 litres of diesel at speeds of 120 kmph on highways. This care is built for long drives and it shows.After sale services:Surprised to say this, but the after sale service of Tata is very good. Very good is a huge leap from very bad in terms of servie of Tata in passenger vehicle segment. The approach to customer and his concerns has changed a lot. They have been provocative all the time in resolving small issues I had initially. And door delivery service, suggestions of what kind of service is apt for the car condition has been excellent so far. Overall, I am happy with customer service till date.
Tata;Harrier;17 Aug 2019;Ninad Khanap..;5.0; Daily Commute ;Post two software updates done on my Harrier a month ago. I should say Tata Motors have resolved the issues I (and I suppose other Harrier owners also) was facing. This has instilled the confidence in me about this product and the service. The last update was done at Bafna Motors, Phugewadi. Really good experience, good people and good service. Keeping the first update for reference. ------------- -------------------------------------Issue with the non responsive accelerator..? I"ve recently found couple of niggles with my Harrier, bought in mid May, running around 3.5k km with one servicing done.Momentorarily changes in the drive modes.. It changes automatically, if the vehicle is in city mode without I changing it for couple of seconds it gets into sport mode. One more issue more frequently happening since a week or so, lack of power while accelerator pressed. Could be for 1 to 4 seconds inspite of pressing the accelerator the engine doesn"t get the power. Just sometime ago while driving in Thane I experienced it, as I lost power I surpressed the clutch and tried to press the accelerator to the floor but still I didn"t get any response, no acceleration! Really disappointed with such issues in such an expensive vehicle and that too within couple of months of buying it. Spoke with the service centre in Thane, they have assured me that it must be a minor issue with the software. And they have given me a slot for Monday to upgrade the software. Mind you during the first servicing they had done quite a few tweaks and also a software upgrade. Anyway, I"ll have my fingers crossed and hope it gets resolved. Anyone out there facing this issue? Thanks!
Tata;Harrier;16 Jun 2020;Mrigank Chat..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car;I would say this is out of the league. A bit on the expensive side but completely justifiable. A complete SUV with all the safety features. The top-end is a couple of lakhs costlier than the top-end of Seltos and Creta. But after taking a test drive I realized it is offering a lot more in those couple of extra lakhs. Space is enormous inside and you feel extremely comfortable even in the back seat . Three people can sit a lot comfortably when compared to KIA Seltos and Creta which are a bit congested if you are well built and tall. It looks very stylish and has more ground clearance. It is a complete SUV .It also offers JBL speakers in the top end.
Tata;Harrier;19 Sep 2020;Shibu Kunnel;5.0; Family Car ;Am a proud owner of Tata Harrier Automatic and bought it replacing my Honda City IVtec after 5 years of use. After test driving Compass, Innova Crysta finally I selected Harrier and I realise that the decision was absolutely right. Tourque convertor is working excellent with the Kryotec engine and tata engineers did an excellent work. Checked also the different ESP modes and working just fine. Onl y draw back what I see is the lack of disc break at the rear, but breaking is just fine. First service done at 1200 km, I can see improvements in the Tata service, may be after Covid issues it will become okay.
Tata;Harrier;30 Sep 2020;Pranab sadangi;5.0; Daily Commute ;Hata Harrier XZA+ is a beast when on sports mode. City and highway average mileage from Thane to Bhiwandi is 12 on sports mode and 14.5 on city drive mode. Tested over 4K km. I drove @ 145 kmph without any vibration. Max speed drove at Pune highway during heavy rain is 165 and could control very well. Breaking is excellent with all safety features. Only glitch is infotainment system. Need to updat e software what they said.. let's see in next service. LED headlights could have been provided.. wish company should opt for LED headlights.Sheer driving pleasure. I enjoy the vehicle to the core..

Tata;Harrier;3 Jun 2020;Himjyoti Bai..;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;Owning Tata Harrier has been a very good decision.Product:Pros:- Beautiful, Macho and dominant road presence- Ride handling is very good, Ride comfort is awesome- Drive quality, ease of gear shift, pick-up and speed are excellent- Music system, Air Conditioning, Seats state-of artCons:- In Cabin noise is higher than competitor vehicles like Compass, Hector- Seating position needs lot of adjustment - Side RVM's are very big creating blind zones during turn.- Build quality needs improvement for 20+ lac INR vehicle; I could feel vibration on Gear Shift Knob while acceleratingCustomer Service:- Looks like Tata forgets that Car and Commercial vehicles are to be treated differently. After sales service is very poor; My all other cars are from Maruti hence its a drastic change in towards negative zone.Suggestions:- Should have launched with AT; I had to buy MT option in BS4- Electronic parking brake would be cool- Tata should come out with small mirrors as spares for Market fitment- 360 deg camera, Sun roof etc can be offered as top end package.

Tata;Nexon;19 May 2020;Arshad Basit;5.0; Family Car | Tours ;Approaching 2½ years and completed 23k kms and countings I'm in love with the diesel motors the grunt, it pulls easy, put in 3rd and drive within city with zero efforts as if you're driving an automatic minimum gear change. In 3rd it can move the car from standstil and pull from as low as 25kmph that's the level of torque it has. Also own a swift vdi and an aspire titanium dragon series but trust me nexon is my fav daily car love driving around with it all in all am happy with my purchase apart from few niggles being an early bird got it within 3 months of launch which were rightly taken care by the TASS guys. Before buying one i had shortlisted nexon and ecosport after test driving one i never looked back at ecosport. Nexon striked all the checklist and its not that am compromising anywhere it being a Tata. Its a myth many carry around about a Tata product. The only thing I'm dissatisfied is the professionalism shown by the service advisors nothing sort of a deal breaker for the potential buyers if one knows how to deal with them. I know how to get things done for me. But, Tata should concentrate on training their staffs basic professional approach on handling customer. Otherwise a thumbs up. Initially got it for my highway drives after driving a dicor for a decade but seems like it has become a daily car now.
Tata;Nexon;31 Jul 2020;Sans Siv;4.3; Daily Commute ;Buying experience: Booked it on 10th Feb got it on 20th May. 1st white Nexon 2020 in chennai / covid19 are reasons. Dealership experience is ok, could be lot better. Riding experience: Engine is refined, ride it slow forget the word mileage. Keep it above 2000 Rpm, you will see a great difference. Engine likes you hard on its accelerator. Exteriors: all good with word compact SUV, other than the c urvy back, which makes it's a hatchback. Interiors: plush finish looks decent gives German car finish in the interiors, all good with Audio- it's Harman nothing much to say.Pros: solid bulit you will feel l seat height l comfort l Anywhere Driveability l Space l last but not least you will feel you are in a safe placeCons: mileage l Tata software technology. My Breakdown experience on the 10th day: Major software glitch caused vehicle to stall in main of chennai. After using 4 cars for over a decade never had a breakdown but my 1st Tata gave it to me on the 10th day. Reason for the glitch nobody knows even in service or direct technical team. They splashed the software gave it back. There hasn't been a issue since then. So future Nexon buyers think twice. But buy an Indian not just in name, but in heart. It's definitely a better car at the cost.
Tata;Nexon;19 Feb 2020;Sudarshan P;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Other than luxury and sheer performance i wanted everything in a car. Among those good amount of ground clearance, decent angle of approach and departure, safety, space, comfort, fuel economy, price were my main points which I was looking for. My budget was stricktly under 10lakh. So there was only one car that was fulfilling all my criteria and that was Tata Nexon XM, petrol manual. I considered Ford ecosport and Hyundai Venue also. Ecosport i rejected it because of the tiny tyres and overall space. Didn't go for venue because it more looks like a soft roader than a muscular SUV. This is my personal opinion only and looks are highly subjective. Did a lot of comparison between Venue and Nexon as Venue had an upper hand in terms of quality, fit and finish but it could not match the Nexon's build quality and driving dynamics, ride and handling. On top of all these things, I am a very big fan of Mr. Ratan Tata and its an Indian brand. So decided to go for Nexon. 🙂
Tata;Nexon;18 Jul 2020;Mukesh Edava..;2.3; Daily Commute ;The new 2020 model looks very good in its face.Also the car is equipped with most of the feutures as well as safety equipments.However the fit and finish is very bad for the amount we pay.I paid around 12 lakhs on road for the xza plus.But the finishing is very poor for what we pay.In my car the left front door was not aligned properly and even after first service they were not able to fix.Also th e engine vibrates more as it is a three cylinder unit.After 3 months of very minimum use itself the dash board and steering console started rattling which is quite irritating.After 10 months of use the car developed rusting of all four door panels near the handle area for which tata provided just repaint instead of a full replacement.Don't fall for the social media hype.Stay away from tata cars because they have several quality issues.They are safe because most of the time the car is safely kept at service centres.
Tata;Nexon;14 Mar 2020;Abhishek Sharma;4.7; Daily Commute ;DRving experience is so far is good but not excellent Reason for good is you will get three driving mode(Eco, city,sport) depending on requirement you can switch the mode, easy to drive and handling with great comfortOverall perormance is good but not very good. As this is AMT so you will feel the delay in gear change if you suddenly push the acclerator.In bumper to bumper traffic i am getting aro und 8-9 KMPL mileage. you will feel the power in sport mode and very stable even at 160 speed. build quality everyone knows so no comment its great.
Tata;Nexon;30 Apr 2020;Ajit Kardekar;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Performance wise nexon is best in its segment with a engine of 1.5 litre diesel engine with a top class interior and comfortable on long route smooth and very tough body of tata as it's one of the best model tata has made i am not a person who just praise like that but it's a ultimate car muv in this range and i have taken test drive of tuv 300, s-cross which i think is not a car to compare with t his,and venue which is 1.4 l engine and EcoSport but this vehicle is best in its segment power comfort milenge toughness everything is perfect.
Tata;Nexon;23 Sep 2020;Bindu Sushil;4.7; Family Car;I bought the car in the month of August from Hyson motors thrissur and within a month the trunk of the car does not work as in it does not open, seemed to the problem of electrical motor of the trunk. We gave it for servicing in Hyson motors potta,chalakudy and they said within 2 days it will be fixed.Its been a month since they said that and whenever we call them for enquiry of the same they just keep on delaying the service. The 5 star rating of nexon can go down to 4 or 3.5 simply bcoz of poor customer service .
Tata;Nexon;26 Mar 2020;Himanshu Sharma;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I won't expect RR or Beemer kind of things from a 12 lakh vehicle, But what Nexon offers you is the Safety, Comfort, Fun of Driving, Fuel Economy and a lot of satisfaction. Have done 10000+ kms in 4 months, and never ever had any major issue apart from the ones that comes with new vehicles like software update, usb port issues.Highly recommended in the budget around 10 - 13 lakh.Now that Mahindra XUV 300 is also 5 Star rated, you have two worthy options in the price range.
Tata;Nexon;21 Sep 2020;Mohit Sharma;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I m sharing my overall experience with tata nexon xz+ Diesel variant After 1 year of purchase. Overall build quality is good. Mileage is about 17kmpl in city and on highway it is 22kmpl. Performance is amazing. You have to switch to Sports mode in hill area.Gear shifting is not so smooth and suspension is hard. Seating comfort is Excellent.The only thing that disappoint is center cup holder its to tally use useless. Too small for Any size of glass.
Tata;Nexon;28 May 2020;Raja Subrama..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Fantastic vehicle on job. No one can believe that it's an Indian vehicle. Structure, superior specifications, safety and comfort for the driver and passengers. Very big wheels in alloy fitted version. I used to drive majority of my drives on highways. Giving me average mileage of 22.50 for a round trip of 409 kms driven in 150 kmph. Amazing, proud to have this vehicle, kudos to Tata and team to ha ve taken Tata's image to very next levels.
Tata;Nexon;20 Oct 2020;Ankit Jain;1.0; Daily Commute | Tours;Purchased tata Nexon xz+ s from kamal & company in September 2020. The car got a problem W.R.T starting the car on the very first day of purchase. The company's executive took the car back to their workshop stating to check the wiring again and returned the car in a few hours saying that everything is fine now. We getting the same problem again 21 times in less than 15 days. On contacting the exec utive, They are asking to directly talk to tata customer care.
Tata;Nexon;15 Aug 2020;ROBESH JOHN;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;1. Comfort is very good, I am 6.3 and 132kg I fit without any issue2. Suspension is Excellent it performs well on bad roads3. Ground clearance gives you confidence, other cars think whether I should go through here or not but I just drive4. AMT gives you little jerks while driving5. Mileage is less but compact SUV's are not made for mileage, and forget about mileage in sports mode, it will give yo u adrenaline Rush
Tata;Nexon;4 Aug 2020;Hrushikesh Jog;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It is a nice and comfortable car to drive it has got similar power to match the safety it has with 5 star globally its just the best compact suv . Surprisingly there are no fit and finish flaws visible it's very sturdy and robust enough for our daily needs just two problem in the whole car is a missing tailgate opening button on the boot lid and small touchscreen
Tata;Nexon;26 Feb 2020;Samir Khan;4.0; Family Car;so far looks good and decent... not high not low as far as performance is concerned...The performance might also be a subjective matter like the design.. I like to drive 'kheench ke' and this this is clearly missing in this when I test drove it.. it does not have the ecosport's sprint nature but is better than many many others in it's category..
Tata;Nexon;1 Dec 2020;J Prasanna;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;A car with an excellent ground clearance. Beautifly styled interiors but the rear passanger leg room is less compared to the old TATA cars. The exterior looks stylish with neat lines. The mileage on the petrol automatic is sad compared to other cars in the category as per my opinion. The car goes smooth post the 1500 mark.
Tata;Nexon;9 Jan 2021;Arnav Sharma;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Overall great csr in this range, I was looking for its competitors and this was the best option I got... Someone suggested me that we can upgrade features in future with availability of funds but we can't upgrade engine in the future. That was the reason I went for Sub compact suv and this was the best decision for me...
Tata;Nexon;14 Sep 2020;J P;4.0; Daily Commute ;I have nexon xma dieseal for past 45 days and driven 2950 km .ifound all is ok except mileage 8-11 in city and 15- 18 on long drive over all dieseal varint average mixed is 15.5..per lit. It is true reveiw. If any one chalange this then he is ........a person of abnormal mentelity and require treatment.
Tata;Nexon;9 Dec 2020;Mahesh Ch;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Few people say the power of tata nexon in not upto mark.Its just like they don't know hot to use/play with drive modes.Coming to mileage if you are using eco mode you will get 16+ in city and 20 in highway.If you want power than mileage shift to sports mode.U can feel the real power of nexon.
Tata;Nexon;2 Feb 2020;Manish Kumar;5.0; Occasional Commute ;A value for money compact SUV. Completely satisfied with the car. Almost over a year and 27000 Kms. No technical issues so far. It has never given below 17 kmpl in thick traffic of Delhi. Mileage 18 Kmpl =delhi, 22 kmpl on the highways. Excellent services by the service center.
Tata;Nexon;10 Aug 2020;Shashi Nagpal;3.0; Daily Commute ;Automatic Transmission is creating so much discomfort. It gets stuck suddenly on any Red Light and it becomes very difficult to move forward. Proving this problem to service people becomes difficult because most of the times it works fine because this problem is not frequent.
Tata;Nexon;17 Feb 2020;Umarfarooque..;1.7; Daily Commute;Mileage is a major issue in becoming xma series. New car 6 to 7 kmpl is city mileage at eco mode drive and 11 to 11.5 kmpl in highway in eco drive mode. So obviously the regular and maintain everything cost increases. So worst experisnce. Totally cheated by TATA motors. Hi
Tata;Nexon;14 Oct 2020;Vimal Venugopal;4.7; Daily Commute ;' Completely Satisfied' Pros - Solid Build , Light Clutch, Powerful AC, Excellent Music system, Good Mileage, High speed stability,long lasting tyres & Less maintenance cost.Cons - Rear view camera quality is not good ,especially at night, small small quality issues.

Everything is fantasticBut now I observed an issue, which is there from the beginning i.e if boot door is opened from inside(press boot door) & get down & then lock the car from the key, there is not horn & If you open the boor door it is opening
Tata;Nexon;28 Dec 2020;Joginder Singh;4.0; Family Car ;Awesome pick up but mileage is very poor.No doubt in safety.Feel good during driving and good storage but internal light used in night, You can't able to find any thing in back seat.

Tata;Nexon;1 Sep 2020;Manish Patel;4.3; Occasional Commute | Tours ;Turbo lag is a major problem otherwise value for money. I want to suggest to TATA through you that interior should be made classy & premium , which is major setback in TATA cars.

Tata;Tiago;28 Nov 2020;Sreedutt V;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I had covered 130000kms (one lakh thirty thousand kms) in 4 years.I own tata tiago diesel.Its a 3 cyclinder revotorq engine its a quiet peppy engine but performs well.Its a very good car in this segment.All of us know about its saftery its a 4 star rated car.I purchased tiago for its fresh look and build quality.So far i did not faced any serious issues and i am happy with the after sales service also.So far so good.Its very fuel efficient motor which doesnt goes down below 19 in city use and will get around 24 to 25 in highways.I had taken to 150 kmph so its a performance oriented engine also.No big issues had faced broken ac vent sliders due to its plastic quality.But as we know tata is cheap for its parts changed it for 250 -350 around that only.Now i had changed my engine timming belt which cost me around 15000rs but now the car is in the excellent condition.I am sure i can use it upto 3 lakh without any engine problem.I guarantee you its worth the money you pay.And as we all know safety should be our main concerns.Beacuse in the car travelling with us is our loved ones.We get what we pay for tata motors.Trust me its not the old tata motors.I preffer tata motors in future also and i reffer to my loved ones.And be the vocal for the local.
Tata;Tiago;13 Feb 2020;Syam Nair;4.3; Daily Commute ;Compared to 2016 and 2017 make tiago, 2018 engines are more refined and fine tuned with no vibration, minimum engine noise, minimum cabin noise. Feature are superb - super sound Harmann musin system, mobile to car speaker blue tooth connectivity both for music, navigation and telephone connectivity. Premium looking car interior. Yesterday I had gone for a 55km + return on a six line highway with t rip meter B set to '0'. At 70/80/90 kms/h car was displaying 25km/l though when I checked trip meter A it was showing 15 km/l. I don't understand why there is a huge difference. If you want see 24km/l on your instrument cluster there is a way. After starting the car while it is moving set trip meter A and B to '0'. Let the trip meter B on your display which will show mileage of the current journey only. while keeping the speed 70-90 km/h your will see the mileage figure rose up to 25 - 27km/l which will shock you. i don't know whether it is actual.Anyway it is a good car with reasonable mileage, superb safety and superb features.
Tata;Tiago;5 Jul 2020;CHENNAI HEALTH;2.0; Daily Commute ;I am using Tata Tiago XZ for past 1 and half years, completed 30k KM, good for long drive and comfort. Coming to my complaints are, the day 1st I took my car from showroom I am facing this issues Unable to close the left side door, you need to give some extra pressure to close the door properly, I made a complaints 100 times they have checked many times but still I am facing the issue, the 2nd iss ue is after applying 2nd gear the car behaviour like some blockage I mean even though if you apply accelator car will not move it will block for some distance and go normally, this 2 issue for the last 1 and half years I am adjusting myself and running the car, I think this is manufactured defect, they have to solve this without delay, if the company not able to solve the issues, how we trust the product... Worst decision that I have bought Tata car....
Tata;Tiago;13 Jun 2020;Vinesh K;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Hi Friends l, My review about Tiago.One the best cars under 7 lakh section. I owned Tata tiago XZ 2020. Car ride quality is awsome. The quality of suspension is more than Hyundai i10 nios and suzuki swift cars. Look wise viewing angle is looks like a sporty hatchback.I found only con that due to three cylinder engine the gear knob is vibrating. Gear shifting is not smooth as Hyundai i10 nios and s wift cars. I feel that one is the only drawback other than it is awsome.Harman audio system is awesome XZ model had 4 speakers and 4 tweeters. Mileage wise I got 18 kmpl at Bangalore city and my 22 kmpl in highway.Safety wise as you all aware Global NCAP 4 star.Am totally satisfied about the car. I love my Tiago.Hope it helps you guys. Take care and safe riding.
Tata;Tiago;11 Feb 2020;Aleena Abin;1.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;I bought a Tiago from tata. It became a biggest trouble in my life in the part of my money because the mileage which that car given for me is just 9km/ltr and the service cost which utilised fromme is lakhs and lakhs. Because my purchase of Tiago my dad had used an Alto 800 in that car we got high mileage and only less and low maintenance charges . The performance that car(Alto) had given for me w as really awesomebut Tiago it's really a worst car I ever driven the driveability is really too worst even the base entry level Alto 800 base Variant is much smoother than the 2017 Tiago so please don't go for wasting your money by buying Tiago it's really a bad car I am saying of from having experience on it
Tata;Tiago;26 Sep 2020;MUSICAL BROT..;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Everyone knows the safety offered by tata in tiago and all their other products . The highway mileage is 24 and city is 16.5 kmpl . The suspension is also excellent and on the softer side which absorbs all the bumps easily and can handle bad roads very easily . Rest there is only two negatives .1. No touchscreen system in 2019 XZ model (petrol) .2. The pickup decreases when ECO mode is on as the c ar then switches to 1000cc engine type and power output comes down from 85bhp to 70bhp only in order to take out good mileage .
Tata;Tiago;9 Mar 2020;Rama Krishna;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Overall it is very good car compared to other hatch back competitors like hyundai santro, i10, celerio, wagnor, kwid and swift. I can it is the best car when it comes to safety, build quality, performance and mileage (my amt xza car is giving 24-25 on highways). But only thing I've observed is little bit noise because tata comes with 3 cylinder. If it starts providing cars with 4 cylinder, then no other can compete with it (this is for sure which I can say0.
Tata;Tiago;25 Sep 2020;Ramanan RV;2.7; Family Car ;Tata Tiago is very Worst Car ever, Because we bought new car in 2016 first XT petrol model. Since 1000km to 2000km vehicle breakdown 5 times. very worst experience. once we went to some place then start the car it is not start, ohhh breakdown. once service provider check some small issue. but charge 1000Rs to 5000Rs. He told sensor locks and fuse issues. i am disappointed to bought this car. Very Worst Experience.
Tata;Tiago;15 Dec 2020;Beautiful Na..;3.3; Daily Commute ;Ye car tab tak safest hi jab tak aap ese tata ke body shop mi nahi le jate & ek bar agar body damage ho jaye or for aap en ke service center se body part change karwate hi to aap ke car safe nahi rahte for aap ko hamesa dar lage rahega because ye aap ke car ko ek dam bekar kar ke aap ko dete hi mere sath ye ho chuka hi.But its my last car for tata ab mi kavi tata use nahi karuga.
Tata;Tiago;1 Oct 2020;Prince PS;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Comfort is very satisfying.Overall driving experience is good. The over all performance is good. Excellent infotainment system.Lacks rear view/ parking camera.Low end pick up is disheartening.Mileage is satisfactory for a 1200 cc car.Built quality and the feeling of safety is excellent.Overall a quality mid segment car.
Tata;Tiago;29 Oct 2020;Ben Rois;4.3; Daily Commute ;Best car with 25 plus mileage assured.[tiago diesel] i love the car so much.The diesel variant gives more mileage than the petrol variant though.It is a fact that the car is having 'some' noise issue but considering the mileage, Safety and low maintenance cost its incomparable with any other car in the segment.
Tata;Tiago;13 Jun 2020;Dinesh Bopche;4.3; Family Car ;faulty gear box i am facing a reverse gear issue other wise a good and better safety while driving on highway its most beautiful and heavy vehicle as well as maintenance cost also minimum comfortable than maruti swift and grand i10. but. tata motors do work her reverse gear issue . very faulty gear box. very poor
Tata;Tiago;28 Jan 2020;Arun Nadig;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Excellent car for a small family. Haven't driven too much in the city. But driven in highways a lot. can say mileage is pretty good getting around 19kmpl. But when it comes to power, generally desire for more and need to shift gears at lower speeds due to non availability of turbo. ps: Engine sound it bit high.
Tata;Tiago;22 Oct 2020;Jebu 001;2.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Overall very good product in driving wise, decent mileage but tata has to work on mechanical glitches, lot of vibrations & rattle noice, flimsy plastic fit & finish, worst of them all this car engine jolts like something is stoping fuel supply in 2nd-3rd gear, which can result fatal if user is on highway.
Tata;Tiago;2 Jan 2021;Avadhut Sadhale;4.7; Family Car ;Zippy yet comfortable ride with feel of safety as well.Performance is good.Overall buid quality is excellent.small amount of cabin nose & minute vibrations probably of empty copassanger seat & parcel tray.After sales service is excellent.

Tata;Tigor;12 May 2020;Sandeep Chow..;5.0; Daily Commute;This is a surprisingly refined and fun to drive car. I have had the car for 18 months and have driven 15000 km. I bought it after evaluating the Amaze, Ameo, Dezire and Verna. On the highway this car has given me and average of 20.8, with AC running but top speed restricted to 100 kmph, on an expressway for 1200 km. In the city she has given me and average of 16.5. The engine is really very refine d and responsive. The power delivery is smooth through the entire RPM range; the gearing is very well planned. The top speed I achieved is 156 kmph (GPS showing 153), wherein the over-speed warning cut in. Even at these speeds, the engine did not run out of breath and did not sound stressed. The interiors are comfortable with ample headroom and leg room for all. The most outstanding quality of the car was its ride quality and handling. The handling is extremely cohesive and steering is very responsive with excellent cornering. The ride quality is very polished and the car gives the feel of much higher segment car. A few drawbacks though - the touch-screen entertainment system is not really that refined. It does not support Android Auto or Apple Car-play. The 'A' pillar is slightly large and the driver instrument display system is a little fussy. The ConnectNext (Tata in-house) app is really poorly designed and does not accord any benefits.Other than these minor faults it’s a smashingly great car and tremendous value for money. The faults listed have been addressed to a large extent (I believe) in the 2020 model. I am planning to buy another Tigor for my wife – it’s honestly that good!!
Tata;Tigor;3 Aug 2020;Shukur Reshma;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have driven my tigor xz+ petrol for a few thousand kilometers and i am very happy with my decision despite friends suggesting not to go with Tata cars. Everyone has their priority aspects while purchasing the car but mine was in the order of safety, comfort, price, mileage, and features. It has bagged 4 stars in NCAP for safety, it's suspension is very good as compared to the other cars in this segment, price is competitive, mileage it gives 20 kmpl (combined) in eco mode. It has the required features. I have driven in the city and went on long drives about 600kms. I feel confident and safe while driving. It never gave me any problem until now. Coming to the cons the styling is not very much impressive and it's a personal choice. While putting the reverse gear i need to apply slightly more force than the forward gears but for me it's ignorable since it's very slight and if I don't apply then it will be stuck in between. Car-related apps are not useful. Just for namesake, they are lying in the Android store. People say tata service centers are not good but i suggest to enquire and go to a good service center. And also you need to deal with the people who disesteem you for owning a TATA :), just be happy on your decision and ignore those people, also keep in mind every car has some cons be it a supercar or budget car.
Tata;Tigor;15 Jan 2021;Jayaprakash HJ;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Tigor is a very worthy car for the price tag. Had got it for 8lk for top end petrol. Now also its almost same even with more features and improved design. Less maintenance for sure. Almost half the maintenance compare to hyundai or vw.Mileage is bit of concern because the car itself is 130-150 kg heavier than the tin cans.But if you drive always below 90 kmph then, Highway mileage of 18 kmpl is gu aranteed with eco modeIn Bangalore city traffic i get 12 kmpl, in mysore traffic 14 kmpl with eco mode not city mode.For two years, i have driven 38000, maintenance has been around 13000 with 5 services. First 3 being labour free. I highly recommed this car for family people.
Tata;Tigor;15 May 2020;Vikalp Sriva..;5.0; Family Car ;A car which will satisfy you in every aspect. The bulid quality of the car is more than awesome.. and the comfort, features it offers at such reasonable price is awesome . And the infotainment system with those Harmon Cardon speakers will just blow your mind.. average of this car is totally depends on how you drive it. In city u will get around 15-16 km per ltr and in highway u will get 21-24 kmpl .. will recommend this car to everyone
Tata;Tigor;1 Jan 2021;Rehman;4.3; Family Car;Why people avoid buying tata cars? after visiting several dealers/ service centers, I a sharing my experience for buying tata car.The only reason is the customer relationship team (sales/marketing or service including tsm ) are very much un- professional.Not care the customer's feedback/ issue.Same as hind motor.You cannot expect the work as per their commitment.That is the one and only reason as i feel but tata's car is excellent.
Tata;Tigor;11 Aug 2020;Yogi 673;5.0; Daily Commute ;I think is the best car in its segment and when you know its from an home grown Indian brand then its more than enough. Only the suspension setup can make you feel like' paisa wasool 'Build quality will never disappoint you an any situation.its almost of same weight as of Maruti ciaz.Thats a big thing.Comfortable, handling and moreover its music system with 4 speaker and 4 tweeter...just wow..Love this car

Tata;NexonEV;16 Aug 2020;Sachin Thakre;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I have booked this Car in Nov 2019 and got the delivery in Jul 2020. I am writing this review after using the car for 1 month. Biggest plus point of this car is ease of driving. It has instant and linear pickup so you don't feel any drag at low speed. There is no engine noise hence you won't know how fast it's going until you look at the speedometer. Teal blue collar is head turner. Many people co me near the car to appreciate the colour. Harmon infotainment system is awesome. Speaker quality is also really good. I am using CarPlay feature with my iPhone and it works flawlessly. Dashboard and Instrument cluster is of premium quality. The regenerative breaking is really smooth and you don't need to apply breaks to slowdown. Vehicle automatically slows down when you remove the leg from accelerator. Charging box and installation was done by Tata Power at my Parking and it was free of cost. It takes 8 to 9 hours to charge fully. It runs around 200 to 210 km on full charge. Fast charging stations are coming up in my city (Pune). Nearest fast charging station is 5 KM from my apartment. Tata zConnect App is also really cool. You can improve your driving style based the stats provided in the APP. It has a lot of remote control features like turning on the AC, Turning on head lamp, Turning on Hazard lights, Run Car Diagnostics, Geofencing, SOS and emergency contact, Valet parking mode, Security breach alerts, Battery charging related alerts, Find nearest charging station etc. Some of the improvement areas are:1. All Tata service stations are not equipped to service this car.2. Auxiliary battery get's discharged if Car is not used for long. This is due to the fact that car is always connected to internet via built in SIM cards to make the zConnect APP work.3. Service staff like road side assistant is not really familiar with the car and struggle a bit. For example my car Auxiliary battery was drained and I had to call the road side assistant. He came really quickly that too on Sunday. He jumps started the car however he was not sure if I need to drive the car to charge the battery or I can keep the ignition and motor on to charge the battery.
Tata;NexonEV;9 Sep 2020;Venkat Raghaven;4.3; Daily Commute ;Am using Nexon EV XZ+ LUX in Chennai for past one month, basically for urban commute. Getting an range of 210km for 100%. Normally I recharge it when it comes to 25% for which I used to get an range of 165 to 170kms (for 75%). This is with AC and infotainment. I have used only AC slow charger till now, never used DC fast charger. - Daily travel distance: 72 to 75 kms - Top Speed: 80 to 90 kmh - Av g. Speed: 35 to 40 kmh (depends on the traffic)- Total distance driven: 2000 kmsPro's:- Running cost is less than Rs.1/- per km- Expecting very less maintenance cost as well- Easy to Zip through the traffic, good pickup and very smooth driving- Build quality, design and comfort. (AC is very good)Con's:- For long distance travel I still depend on my petrol/diesel cars.

Tata;TiagoNRG;12 Apr 2019;DILEEP D;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Driven 3500 Km in a single ride, no problems at all, comfort, easy drive, excellent music system, AC is also good enough, little noisy engine but it is acceptable because of pure Indian like us. 4yrs extended warranty by Tata motors is great. Tata motors service team in overall India is doing a wonderful job because of their behaviour, technical qualification, experience and excellent customer re lation and need definitely to be appreciated. Feel a great experience with NRG as well as the service team. At the mileage side, when safety comes to mind there is no option to ask "kitna mileage" but I got 18km/l on highways and 13-14 in local drives and hope it will be increased after 1st engine oil change ie; the second service. The overall performance of the vehicle and Tata motors service are great and remarkable. I was in search of a little hatchback with sporty look, ground clearance, roof rails, dual tone colour, claddings, armour plate, rear spoiler etc with advanced safety features like Airbags, ABS, EBD and corner stability control etc since Aug 18, and proposed many cars in this segment, and finally choose NRG as the winner after its release on 12 Sep 18 and take test test drive. Hope, Tata Motors will release updates like rear cam, buzzers etc for this car soon. My final rating is 5/5 for NRG 5/5 for Team Tata Motors. Congrats...!
Tata;TiagoNRG;24 Mar 2019;Lucky Thacker;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I'm from a Small Village where Everyone has Mentality that Tata is not a Good Brand and Hyundai i20 and Suzuki Swift or Baleno are Only Good in Market.A lot of people Told us to Not Purchase Tata Product, But when everyone Experienced this Beauty, all of them were awestruck. 1 of My Father's Friend Already Planned to Purchase Tiago. And another one is Already Considering Harrier over Creta.Tiago N RG has very Smooth Drive Handling, We've Purchased Diesel Variant as My Father has Too Much Daily Running. Till Date Car Gave us Mileage of 20-24 kmpl which is beyond our Expectations. Also, This has The Toughest Car Body when compared with Segment.Major Plus Point of this Car is its Music System by Harman. MAN!!NONE OF THE CAR IN THIS SEGMENT OR UPPER SEGMENT HAVE SUCH GREAT SOUND QUALITY I CAN BET.A lot of Peoples says that Tata Car makes a lot of Noise and Vibrations. But That's not True with Its New Cars, I want to mention that You would Never ever Realise that Negligible Difference when Compared to Other Diesel Cars. Surely there's some Difference but Definitely not Remarkable.Frankly, I was a Tin ka Dabbas Fan Earlier but Tata Amazed Me with This Package

Hexa has problem of Engine head leakage s my brand new cars engine was opened before completing a year and even the engine belt is making noise. i feel really sad that my new car engine was opened even if they have fixed it completely still i will suggest if you want to go for 7 seater or 6 seater then go for INNOVA if your budget is around 18-19 lakh.

Tata;Nexon20172020;24 Oct 2018;Home Android;1.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Yes, it’s true the looks and features we became so much fan off, were not so smart features after all. In1plain and simple words the common-sense was totally missing from this vehicle.! Yes, you read it correctly,1the common sense is not their at all in TATA NEXON XZ+. First, the Dancing Mirrors…! Scenario:- You just1came out of your home and stepped in your car ….……as soon as you will p ush the “Start/Stop(SS) Button1only once…….your rear blower will start……? Dude I am sitting in the front…….you should have1started the front blowers….? As mostly it’s single passengers sitting in the Cars………so why the hell1in the world you are starting the rear blower first.? Strange it is……! Then for the Front blowers you1press the SS button once again……okay the Ignition is “ON” now, with front blowers….Good…….but1why the hell the Side View mirrors are opening……? I have not even started the car yet and maybe I was just1not going to go anywhere at all………but why the Side View mirrors are opening if I am not going1anywhere.….? Talked to TATA MOTORS……they said it’s a Welcome feature in Top variant……so can’t do1much about it…! Okay, then I closed the Rear view mirrors by pushing the inner controller downward….cool,1they are close now. Now, I start the Engine to go to my office by pressing the SS button(along with Clutch)1third time, engine starts….perfect…….Side View Mirrors open again…? Dude you just lost it…….It’s1insane……I am such a driver that never uses the Rear view mirrors, and always do the lane driving…….!1So, TATA engineers should have given some sort of disabling mechanism for Side View mirrors’ traumatic dance1moves again n again……! Keep it simple guys and don’t make a mess of such AI integration…….we are1humans and we don’t need such repeated welcomes by our daily ride……just for starting1engine…….twice……jeez.! Mockery of the SS Button? Suppose you have just reached somewhere, want to Stop1the car engine, and simply need to wait for someone……….and keep the Blower/ Fan “ON”……….dude1you need to press the SS button three times…….! Just to “Stop the Engine and keep the FAN ON”. Let me1do it for you…….First SS Button press shuts the ENGINE OFF(along with Ignition+ FAN+ Rear1Blower-everything “OFF”)……….Second Press, re-starts the rear blower…….Third press, re-starts the1front blower / fan for you…….now you can wait for your someone.……! TATA engineers could have just Shut1the Engine off and kept the Fan/ Blower running in the single press…….isn’t it simple and easy……!1But TATA don’t want you to wait for anybody in your car…….specially with your fan “ON”. Or be ready1to press it three repeated times…….! Second, the Central locking……again without common-sense….!1Guys, you’re just not safe in TATA NEXON specially the XZ+ model….yes the top variant is specially1designed for only those people who have enough of money to be targeted by robbers again and again……!1Don’t believe me…….just trying stopping at any red-light and ….and……and don’t try to STOP the1engine……….ever……ever……ever…….forget the fuel economy / environment pollution / fuel1conservation…………don’t Switch OFF your engine at any cost…….Because, the moment you will do1this…….NEXON has opened all the four gates for your being vulnerable to robbers outside your car…….!1THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST SHOCKING OF THEM ALL…….! It’s been one month now…….I never switched off my1engine at any red-light or anywhere other than my office or my home………I FEEL SCARED…….IN NEXON XZ+.1AS I CANNOT TURN OFF MY ENGINE ANYWHERE AT ALL…….I MUST, IMMEDIATELY PRESS THE LOCK/UNLOCK KEY DOWN BELOW1TO RE-LOCK ALL YOUR DOORS…….AND JUST HOPE THAT YOU ARE FAST ENOUGH THAT NO ROBBER/ MOLESTER / RAPER HOPPED1IN YOUR CAR YOU WILL START FEELING SAFE AGAIN IN YOUR CAR…! Third…….only until you open your drivers’1door unlock lever…….!? Yes, I travel mostly alone from my home to office and then back…….! The moment1I open my(driver) unlock lever….all the doors will open……? Dude this is not Central locking……! If I1need to open all the doors I will use the Lock/Unlock Button on the front console…….! I am just opening my1Doors lever to unlock and TATA has once again left you completely vulnerable……by opening all four1doors……! You can also add My Laptop on the Back seat, lying their with all Car gates open…….for the1uninvited snatcher…….….just waiting to be picked….…….jeez…….….I’m once again scared, even1my laptop is scared now….….! Now you know….why I told that common-sense is missing in this Car.! Fourth,1You cannot leave your Elderly people inside the Car…… in a NEXON XZ+. Yes, don’t blame TATA for1this……….you should not bring any Non-technical(or not so tech friendly people along with you in the1NEXON car)……….or teach them to immediately press the Lock/Unlock key(on Dashboard) for closing all doors1& for their own safety. Scenario:- My father/ mother both senior citizens, sitting in the car….me driving1….okay. Now, I stop for a moment to bring something from the Market enroute……they both are still sitting1within the car…….! I think I should leave them with atleast fan/blower “ON”…….or they may suffer1due to lack of ventilation / air.! So, the Ignition is kept “ON”….so the blower can work…….Now you1stepped out of the car, you just pulled your door unlock- lever…….once again all the doors are1open………….immediately teach them to press the Dashboard Key with “Lock/Unlock” Icon on1it………because even if you are carrying the Key in your pocket…….and you try to lock the Car by the1key in your hand from outside…….all the doors will remain open as the Ignition is “ON”….! What good1is the Mainkey button Lock when the Ignition is “ON” – NO Good.! Only way to close “ALL” the doors1in such a scenario….make your not so Tech-friendly old parents….learn some tech finally….…….as TATA1has once again left them totally vulnerable from outside attacks………! I hope you are getting to the main1issues, I’m trying to highlight here……….! Mileage………please don’t ask…….not atleast1me….please.….! My car has just ran 500 Kms in total run…….and the average shown in the meter for that1500 kms is 10.0……………….! Yes, the Trip meter which I never reset right from the start………is showing the1average of 10 kms for the whole life distance of 500 kms……! Forget the claims TATA motors / or ARAI did for 17 kms average……! You’re most welcome to see my Trip meter with 500kms total Car run at 10.0 kms average.! Live example for you to see. I had a word yesterday at my Dealer he simply said please don’t go with the Meter gauge…….they do not show the true picture…….!1Go for full –tank and then do the Mileage calculations. I mean okay……but didn’t he meant to say that1the Tata Fixed our NEXON vehicles with Faulty Meters….? On enquiring further he said he is a New joiner from1SKODA Motors….………and he agreed that my above mentioned points are very valid and their must be some1way to disable them through some computer setting….…….”but the actual person who can do this is not1present now”…………so maybe tomorrow he replied…….……….when the engineer will come they will1inform me…….!
Tata;Nexon20172020;22 Aug 2019;B Praveen;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Purchased XZA+ on 20/6/2019 from Ambattur, Chennai. High vibrations in 1st gear and while reversing from day 1. Weird noise after applying brake from front and back. Complained at service centre - though they are courteous they did not accept that there is a fault in the vehicle. Complained twice to CEO Concorde and Tata Motors. Car was in service centre for 7 days - clutch was defective to be rep laced along with fly wheel, for that Service center made me to take AMC Gold which I am not interested but paid to get my car out of service center. Problems still persist - but as per TATA these are normal:1.Swing motion of car like wooden horse toy(min 3 times) after applying brake.2.Weird noises after braking -various types of sounds can"t be explained.3.Engine knocking sound while AMT changes gears from 1 to 2 to 3 - even bus/truck will not have this type of sound. Inconsistent and mis fits in interior plastic -looks premium but of cheap quality plastic - any item you place in glove box, sun glass folder, water bottles in door panels will give sound / vibration.And lastly forget about mileage - in city traffic 6 to16.5(petrol).Complete package of unpleasant driving in city traffic.
Tata;Nexon20172020;19 Nov 2018;HPFC Dot;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Sharing My Yesterday (18/11/2018) Experience:- Tata Nexon Kraz Plus (Petrol) is Best Level Compact SUV till now as per my 700 Kilometer Local Drive Experience. All Doors Side Rubbers protectors came out easily on dust cleaning. Driver Side Front Pillar visibility issue and creates right side blind spot. Others no issue find in this compact SUV.Very Poor Level Tata Service Centre (Hartron Motors LL P, Sector-18, Gurugram) Washing, Air, Vacuum & Cleaning Service.Never advise to take this Washing & Cleaning service there. Best Quality Services available outside Service Stations at various locations in Gurgaon with cheaper cost within 45-60 minutes maximum.But Tata Service Centre staff don"t know the cleaning process of cars. They don"t wash, air, vacuum service properly.Dust inside cabin after Air Pressure and Tree Leaves left outside Wiper Area after wash remains in car washing, after than vacuum cleaner service also very bad and at last on remaining dust of inside the dashboard, they done the polish work for brightness increasing.Small Mud stains still remains outside the car body, which are very easily removable with wet cloth in-front of them I clean with my finger only.I don"t understand what they have done in my SUV in the name of washing & cleaning from 12:34 PM to 4:45 PM (4 Hours ++ Time Taken and All time I keep standing there and watched all their activities on other cars also.)At last I have took the gate pass, because I have to go somewhere for meeting.As per my experience totally dumb & untrained staff at washing & cleaning service.
Tata;Nexon20172020;1 Sep 2019;Ishaan Agrawal;4.0; Daily Commute ;I own an XMA petrol and have done about 1600KM now. The performance improved a bit after the first service (checkup) but it seems like the mileage has taken a further hit. I"ve been observing the a mileage of 7KM/L in city driving and I don"t rush. And this is extremely disappointing. I can"t even blame the gearbox because I drive in manual mode so I can shift when I want to. I usually shift at ab out 2K RPM. Now another problem is that since it isn"t a high capacity engine performing duty in a heavy car, the dependency on the turbocharger is high. Now to work around the turbo lag, one needs to put the foot down to get a quick move on.So, this is like a vicious circle Nexon Petrol owners have gotten caught in. I believe and desperately hope Tata fixes this issue, as this definitely will affect the owners
Tata;Nexon20172020;14 Dec 2019;Nishant Gaikwad;2.0; Daily Commute;Don't Buy TATA Nexon XMA or XZ Plus Petrol Version, I Own one & its pathetic- Things 1) Average, Even though company claims that it has 17 'ish something, In city its 7 to 9.7 km/lit only, before 1st service it was 5 km/lit can you believe...its like taking white elephant at home.. 2) AMT thing is all rubbish, its slow pick up like hell & roll back on gradient, Believe me i own this from 2 months & took car to dealership for 3 times, its performance is too sluggish, pick up is like shit. 3) Car built might be strong yet it has obstruction in vision due to thick side beam & rear you will hardly get much to see.
Tata;Nexon20172020;9 Nov 2019;Chinmai Krishna;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;A perfect family car, gives excellent safety and features. The is low end turbo lag in petrol varients but still a powerful car that can be used for any purpose. The suspension is so good and the driving is really fun. The mileage is also not bad considering the mass of the vehicle. I get around 15-18 kmpl on highways if driven properly. For me 0-100 comes at 11 seconds. This car doesn't have any problem driving through bad roads it takes them with ease. If you are a person looking for a multipurpose car this is it. This is a good family car and also can be driven for pure fun(be safe).
Tata;Nexon20172020;28 Sep 2018;Singh Rahul;4.0; Daily Commute ;Nexon is not just VFM but a great experience car. In few areas, it's difficult to even match it but my personal experience with car has not been so great ! Being a completely new car from scratch from tata stable,it has it's own share of issues. Rattling issues and random mechanical issues decreases the confidence on the car + in-experience of service staff make the issues and whole experience of owning a good car takes a hit!!!Rattling noises from plastic to mirrors, issues in basic car mechanic like gear-box problem in slotting 2/3/4 gear during driving, gear lever getting stuck on 3 gear , steering column noise, steering getting stuck on either of extreme ends, suspension rods noise etc are just few examples I've faced or facing currently.It's these experiences which eclipses the goodness of the car which are comfort of choosing different driving modes, classy interiors & exteriors, superb rear seating comfort, practical usable features etc PS: I drive daily 100+ kms to office with around 85+ kms in highway still getting not the best of results in terms of mileage
Tata;Nexon20172020;25 Sep 2019;Baskar Sport..;1.0; Occasional Commute ;Hi my name is bakar I have taken tata nexon 6 month before from KHT motor domlur .they are very good in sales till the deal completes,after no one will call even for the delivery ,i was waiting 2 hour to take the car ,That s OK .the service today 25/09/19 nobody called I called once for the service they charged me 400 Rs for pickup the car my car millage is only ( 7 KM ) regarding I spoke with the service team till now no response .please check The service and millage Before deciding This car . my mobile number is 984****471. disappointed customer
Tata;Nexon20172020;29 Oct 2020;Jai Prakash;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;This is my family's first car. Really happy with the features and styling. But company should work on the their software and infotainment system. It is not seamless, it's laggy. Features are top notch but what is the use when they does not work seamlessly and properly. Company should resolve this issue in the future updates. Riding quality is good although instant pickup is missing in every mode. It's not a sports car but engine refinement is needed so it can be fast in no time.
Tata;Nexon20172020;13 Dec 2019;Ed Sukesh;4.0; Tours ;Overall performance and comfort for long distance driving is very good. I like the way the car handles on the road and the steering is quite responsive. AMT is excellent in sports mode on highways. The %5 star Ancap rating is reassuring and the car does feel solid. The fit and finish could be better and the touch screen more responsive and bigger but these are not critical. The car has performed v ery well over some rough terrain. Sure it does not have snob value but who cares.
Tata;Nexon20172020;23 Nov 2018;Dinesh Thiya..;4.7; Family Car ;Its worth and value for money. Tata has made such a good quality solid build car. Multi driving modes is superb choice and you feel the response immediately.Front seats are so good and most important is that rear seats are having much thigh support which is helpful in long driving. Mileage as on today i got 16.5kmpl which is really good keeping the weight 1200-1300kg. I was looking for baleno ini tially but then if u spend 1L extra, its worth single penny. In globabl NCAP crash teat, it scored 4star for adult and 3star for child occupant. Headrooms could have been increased a bit more. Huge, heavy and safest car with decent mileage, good driving experience is a pleasure
Tata;Nexon20172020;23 Nov 2019;Manabendra T..;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Good experience,I am an owner of a xza+revotron nexon.it is a very good car.in high way,it gives 15 .5 to 16 km/l ,(full tank to full tank method) in eco mode . riding comfort is superb,I took it to tawang ( 13000 feet from see lavel) from guwahati after 3rd day of purchase with full load and the Tata kid completed the return journey very comfortably.
Tata;Nexon20172020;3 Dec 2019;Jo;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;stunned to see the interiors when stepped into the uber car.Great interiorsdash off centre like in s luxury segment or above it? nice steering cover great suspension smart digital console low engine noice satisfied with it till the driver doubted about Tatas service.but I was optimistic this time .thanks.
Tata;Nexon20172020;27 Dec 2018;Pranesh Upashi;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Overall a very good Car.-XZ+ petrol Good features : comfortable Bucket seats, 5Start NCAP rating will confirm the safety of the vehicle, Very good Suspension, Power at the cost of Millage,3 drive modes -City, Eco,Sports, Spacious Boot space, Golve box with cooler Needs Improvement : Gear change is hard, Steering is heavy, Indicator knobs needs to be softer, Eco mode power is not sufficient to over take on highways, Difficulty in latching the rear seat belts as the buckle tends move too inside .Millage after 7000km : Eco- 15-18 kmpl, City- 13-14 kmpl, Sport
Tata;Nexon20172020;30 Jan 2019;San B;4.7; Daily Commute;I bought the base model. Had taken her out on highways on two occasions.... once the average was 22 km/ltr and on second time it was 25 ...Blessing in disguise ...the car is wonderful to drive..... with minimum effort you can sail on the road..... 3 modes are fantastically made.... on sports mode it"s a beast ( through average will be low) but it can test your limits and skills.... I took it to 17 5 on arga lucknow express way....and there was no sound at all.... control is excellent but need to work on braking... Overall nice experience in 8 lakhs....
Tata;Nexon20172020;3 Sep 2019;Saravanan Su..;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I bought Nexon XZA+ Petrol variant 20 days back. So far driven around 435 KMs. Yet to go for any long drive. Only drove in Bangalore city traffic. I am worrying more about the mileage consumption. In the odometer, it shows only 8 KM. Will it improve post 1st service. Any honest feedback?
Tata;Nexon20172020;20 Apr 2019;Aarsh Gawande;2.3; Daily Commute ;Only 2* because of their service. This car deserve 5*, Tata has made a superb car a perfect machine. So far drove 2000km no issue,awesome vehicle. I love it. Concorde motors will ruin Tata brand. Unprofessional managers and staff, full of liars. Even after 2 months they didn"t provide accessories. Denied 2 year extended warranty which was committed. They don"t bother whether your car is washed or not at the time of delivery. Guys never go there if you want to buy nexon find some good dealers in your area.
Tata;Nexon20172020;30 Sep 2020;Amith Nataraj;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Really good family car especially performance, comfort at the back. Really good handling, and takes bumps really really well. No issues whatsoever till now from Jan 2019. Only con which I feel is A-pillar during curves and for a petrol engine, noise is quite vocal.
Tata;Nexon20172020;5 Dec 2019;Vedanshu Sac..;4.0; Daily Commute ;Few features are lacking out which should be mandatory.1 - Automatic lock when car moves 2- Boot can only be opened from inside of the car. i.e. if you just have to open boot, first you have to enter the car, press button, then only you can access boot.
Tata;Nexon20172020;8 Aug 2018;Biswaroop Deb;2.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I would like to give a feedback on my recent purchase of TATA Nexon in Kolkata.I got the delivery in the month of February . Till now around 4700 KM I have driven in the city. But I found the mileage of the car is extremely poor.It is about 7.26kmpl. I had visited the workshop . They then drove the car is a semi ideal condition and found the mileage around 16kmpl.I had specifically told them the city mileage is extremely poor. They could do nothing.
Tata;Nexon20172020;1 Jan 2020;Tanishk Raj;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;The best part of what I like about my car is its build quality and of course its crunchy style as the modern SUV's need instead of a boxy like appearence or a lame suv with a lame wheel at its rear boot lid......

Tata;Nexon20172020;6 Jun 2019;Rajan Gupta;4.0; Daily Commute ;It is very nice and smooth in running SUV.I enjoy driving on this AMT car. The local city mileage is very low it gives 11 and 13 on highway. I did on it its first service so far. I think mileage may improve after 3 services as told by the company , lets hope for the best. Its breaking system is very poor. On hills it is not very successful.

Tata;Nexon20172020;8 Oct 2020;Suman Kumar;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Hi, I'm sharing my review after completing an year of ownership and a good 23000 Kms on various terrains. It's a complete made in India and value for money product with leading benefits of : Road presence, strong armour, fuel economy (if you drive with optimum revz), stable on all terrains (I tried on highways, hills, careful off-roads and what else!), cabin space - specially the thigh support for long journeys, confident braking effects, good steering controls, optimum maintenance cost and safety.Scope for improvement : 1. NVH is higher as compared to it's competitors2. Useable roof rail could've helped more (for carrying your trekking equipment atleast)3. Foldable rear tray would add ease of access from inside
Tata;Nexon20172020;4 Oct 2020;Abhishek Singh;4.7; Daily Commute ;I bought this car by comparing its features against price. Safety was my second concern and compact suv was the third point which Nexon tick right. Driving in city as well as highway is very stable and there is no trouble in comfort even in bumper to bumper traffic. Seating position is higher which gives feel of domination in traffic where most of the hatchbacks are plying usually. Fuel economy is little concern with around 9-10kmpl on petrol but it’s justified when it’s churning so much power which is higher than breeza. Shock absorbers are well fitted and jerking is less and smooth drive. Car feels spacious and boot size is bigger than breeza and other competitor. There is brand assurance of Indian company Tata and service centre has better reach and services. Parts are not costly. Built is very robust and iron sheet used is so strong than little hatchbacks won’t be able to create dent in traffic if collide at low speed. Overall very good balance of price, features, safety, technology and aspiration of an Indian customer.

Tata;Tigor20172020;31 Mar 2019;Sanjay Kumar;4.3; Family Car ;Hello everybody. I purchased xz+ on 28th March, drove straight way for about 150 km on highway in the night. Pros - Got 22 km mileage, Excellent comfort seating, Lights are very good, Suspension superlative, Music by Harman world class. Cons - Engine a bit noisy, AC noisy but very effective at low rpm, even Apple car play missing, DRL missing, Rear armrest without a string for pulling it outside A C vents, simple looking with low quality adjustable nobs. At the very start of engine, a typical irritating noise comes out for a second. During drive at 80 km speed a burning smell, which I could not figure out. Two times happened. Conclusion, excellent buy keeping all the positive and negative in mind at such price, no other cars stands even near to it except Ford Aspire. Lastly build quality of Tigor is really marvellous. Hope to see the service part standing postive also. Tata motors must keep a bird's eye on it if it has to deliver consistently in the market. Within fortnight I shall be experiencing the service aspect.
Tata;Tigor20172020;23 Oct 2020;Manoj Das;5.0; Family Car ;Good all-round car.Only negative is that of the road noise which is audible inside the cabin.Since it has a 3 cylinder engine, So engine noise is evident.I did not have much knowledge about cars when i bought it.May be i would have bought another company car had i known this things before.
Tata;Tigor20172020;19 Jun 2019;Ashish Panchal;2.3; Family Car ;Customers should not buy the Tigor, even my suggestion customers should not by Any TATA motors products,as after sales they dont care about the customers, i purchased vehicles 20 days back i have worst experience, not good in brake down services . dont have spare at dealership, not able to provide temp vehicle once your vehicle in accident claim. mileage is just 12 in AMT. after complain in TATA m otors no revert from any one. unprofessional company with out having any understanding of customers requirement.
Tata;Tigor20172020;21 Dec 2019;Sanjeev Deka;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Tigor truly gives you a very premium quality interiors and A1 level driving comfort. Suspension in Tigor is of next level, no other car in same price range gives you similar experience.Music system is also one of the most premium feature with 8 speaker sound system.
Tata;Tigor20172020;8 Jan 2019;Prabagar Cap..;4.3; Daily Commute ;Tata Tigor is an excellent good looking car with good mileage at this price segment. The car has all the nextgen features with in built Harman kardon speakers (8 Nos) which makes this car the best for this price comparing the other cars in the market. When performance comes into picture, it feels heavy and pickup is that good enough since it has the 3 cylinder model. After all, Tata tigor is one o f the best product from TATA and it worth every single penny that you spent.
Tata;Tigor20172020;29 Feb 2020;Abhijeet Hinge;4.0; Family Car ;When bought in 2018 it was the best value for money car that time with the amount of features that comes in. The city mileage is around 12 to 13kmpl ,whereas on highway it gives minimum of 18 kmpl.
Tata;Tigor20172020;25 Nov 2020;Suresh Valuva;5.0; Family Car ;The best in class performance and features are provided by tata at convenient price.Who likes drive, Seating and music.And any.Can never afford to forgo this cute sedan.Ofcourse stylish too.
Tata;Tigor20172020;19 Dec 2018;Umesh Verma;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;I own XZA variant, that is amt in top avatar. It's awesomely convenient, feels much more safer once inside.For those who thinks amt's are not exciting you also get a Sport mode that will surprise you even if you are cruising at 100kph. It's a lovely car with beautiful sound system. The only thing I miss is electronically foldable ORVMs
Tata;Tigor20172020;28 Nov 2020;Laxmi Narayana;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Excellent sedan at that price range go for it, mileage city -15 , highway-19 , suspension is very good, amt is on bit slow pickup intially but it's not a big problem
Tata;Tigor20172020;20 Apr 2019;Dinesh Kumawat;4.0; Family Car ;Comfort and built quality is superb. Low cost of the car. Most disappointed point is that we can hear engine noise in cabin so easily despite it is a petrol car. But it is 1-2 lakh rupees cheap than top model of Amaze and Dzire. Average in highway is mind blowing above 20 but in city it delivers around 14-15.
Tata;Tigor20172020;17 Jul 2019;Rohit Patil;4.3; Occasional Commute ;Overall a great car, bang for the buck kind of value for money. Could definitely do with a bigger engine and more power. And tata should work on the nvh level for sure. Other than that no issues at all. 100% recommended for a long test drive before buying other car in this price range.

Now i have decided to retain my Safari Storm KL 03 X 8400, 29800km covered. But if i change it I will go for Ford Endevour.

I had a other car so not much used. Yearly service was maintained as per the schedule. Car is good to drive in cities and i didn"t feel that bad as people comment on this car. Its a two cylinder engine, little noisier than other cars but its manageable. At this price point the car has some good features and it ha s excellent space compared to my other car(felt not to mentioned as i can purchase 2 Nano;s from its price). Nowadays it become my daily drive and i am really enjoying it. Cheap to maintain and its strong than it looks. little more feature like front disk breaks would be suggestible if they are again introducing it.

Enjoy the ride !
Tata;Nano;11 Apr 2019;Ajay Goswami;2.7; Occasional Commute ;I & my wife especially use Tata Nano as standby Car. But we feel very comfortable while driving due to easy1access to get inside,specious, great visibility from driver seat. Intermittent servicing is required1particularly for Gear adjustment ,otherwise it is excellent due to it's easy maneuvering (Handling) and it goes very fast. Happy,not able to dispose even after 7years /38000km running.

Tata;Vista;8 Feb 2020;APACHE RTR;4.0; Family Car ;It's a wonderful Car offering the best of features along with the safety among contemporary cars. But it disappoints on mileage front, as it delivers around 11 in the city and overall highway mileage is 14 on AC, if driven 80+, 16 if driven below 70. I feel it's turbocharger is the main cause for low mileage, it should have been properly tuned, but at the same time, you never feel short of power u pto 100.
Tata;Vista;25 Feb 2019;Vidya;4.0; Daily Commute ;I love my Indica Vista.. but I guess owing to the ageing of the vehicle the car has been giving a lot of repair works which is quite natural. However, the mileage during good and merrier days was not more than 11kmph on regular commuting roads within city and just about 14-16kmph on long drives at an accelerated speed pointing between 70-85. But overall it"s a lovely sturdy steady vehicle with amp le space inside and very comfortable to drive and maneuver with ease on the roads ... simply loved every bit of my journey with this handsome honcho, Indica Vista ofcourse ... ;-p ...
Tata;Vista;4 Nov 2020;Percy Jassawala;5.0; Family Car;The Vista D90 has superb acceleration and the Vista's cavernous interior design allows the whole family (and sometimes more) experience the mighty diesels pull.

Tata;Safari20052017;12 Jan 2019;Sunjeet Kumar;3.0; Daily Commute ;After owing and driving for 8 years I find this car is good for 7 person all can get in and out easily and travel together but as my SAFARI is old model it lags engine refinement has too much engine noise doesn't has abs ebd airbags body roll is too much while normal drive as its too high above ground etc. Mine is 4x2 model but still I use in some little sluggish mud and sand areas and I am able t o get out from such situation. As its a big SUV so parts are big and expensive also very hard to get original. Like my EGR valve is not working.I am forced to use without EGR valve.The build quality is not so good either. Average is too low in city you will get 8kmpl and on highway 10kmpl.The clutch is placed too high and is hard always no matter if I get new clutch set within a month it gets hard I always buy TATA genuine parts from dealers. For a 6ft height person like me you sure will get pain in your ankles and knee cuz the SAFARi needs change in gears frequently it can not pull you out even 3 rd gear if you are in speed of 20 to 25. the engine will start hesitating making you to shift to lower gears which makes the driver restless while driving.I have driven 8 to 12 hrs continuously which makes me too tired. Its just feel outdated and boring and feels a burden of owning such car.I suggest anyone opting for 7 seater SUV just go for compact SUV 5 seater for max 5 to 6 years and agian buy a new 5 seater SUV beacuse in todays price of 7seater suv you can own 2 different types of 5 seater compact suv each for 5 to 6 year which would be equivalent to one 7 seater suv in terms of price plus you always have an updated features in your car for life.

The 3.0 ltr engine has lots of low-end torque and the turbo kicks in at 1000 rpm. The suspension is superb for cruising as well as for city rides. Spare parts are costly since the tax on parts for luxury vehicles is quite high. There is lots of legroom and headroom, so tall people will never complain.

Kia;Seltos;10 Jan 2020;Abani Behera;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;a good car in terms of feature spec. Spacious cabin. Drive quality is good but not the best. Hyundai Creta provides better drive quality. Features like the 360 Degree camera, air purifier, AC vented seats are pretty nicely implemented. Great fan of the 360 camera. Have been using this feature in narrow lanes. Although the petrol engine is not noisy but you can still hear bit of noise (Not like the Hyundai where the cabin noise is almost zero). In slow speed the vehicles is not that smooth but the moment we cross 30 KM, its pretty smooth. Eco mode makes you feel that the car doesn't have much power.Normal is good overall. Sports has a great power punch but noisy. I prefer normal mode in most of the time.UVO app works fine only when the car eSIM (Vodafone) is under good network coverage. DCT transmission temperature is a serious problem (at least for Bangalore). in bumper to bumper traffic it keeps on getting heated and an alert keeps on coming in the cluster to stop the car. Not sure if this problem will be fixed. But with this we can not drive in Bangalore during peek hours. So far i liked my car until the transmission issue appeared. Now it looks I can not drive it regularly in Bangalore traffic.
Kia;Seltos;22 Jan 2020;Zia ul haq butt;4.0; Family Car ;If you are really looking for the rivals of Kia Seltos then there must be your's internal choice to chose what you want and looking for yourself. I rejected xuv300 just because of boot space. Duster was always my first love but novelty and dashboard killed my mindset...Jeep compass certainly impressed me by its dashing look but mileage was the critical point of understanding. Later MG Hector was s omething new & impressive option but over design & writing BIG internet inside long queuing pulls me back then there was final option Kia Seltos which changed my mind after getting into inside and i was trying to find out fault but only one fault 'highly important' could find was the safety feature 2 airbag given in kia seltos htx plus AT 1.5 diesel automatic variant .I'm still thinking on it why it was compromised and not given 6 airbags. Rest everything is OK. I have drove it 5500kms in couple of months, city 14 Kms highway 18 to 19 Kms mileage without any problem.
Kia;Seltos;30 Aug 2020;Niraj Balani;2.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Issue 1 The map is a complete waste. I entered the location of my club and it navigates me to a hospital.The map has no idea about the traffic, as there is no realtime calculation of traffic. Google maps are far better than the inbuilt kia mapsI have communicated with my dealer i.e Shreenath Kia, Thane. The name of my sales person was Varun, He suggested us to use google maps. The map was a huge a ttraction for the customer but in real it is of no use. Issue 2The second issue is always the mileage. Kia commits its 16.7kmpl average, but in reality the average is about 8-9 kmpl for the petrol dct variant. The average is 50% less than claimed by kia.When I raised the complaint about average. I was informed it will give you this average at expressway. Will we drive daily to expressway?Issue 3Kia took some additional insurance amount by mistake and after 2 weeks of continuous follow up, we still haven’t got any reply from kia.
Kia;Seltos;6 Jan 2020;Anish Moideen;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;A good car with great handling and advanced features. Pros - styling, power, steering, a/c, HUD, voice command, navigation, 360 camera, parking assist, sunroof, ventilated seats, but worth the money. Cons - tyre size, rear shock absorbers, boss subwoofer, space inside, luggage space, front bumper ground clearance, UVO IOS app, front seat head rest stitching, driver seat thigh support. Could have e asily improved few of the items to suit Indian conditions.
Kia;Seltos;12 Jun 2020;Asif Karimulla;4.7; Family Car | Tours ;Power is very linear, Kia should either provide turbo retrofit or hybrid retrofit kits to the existing customers at a decent price point as an optional accessory, Seltos has created a history benchmark, now assume Hybrid retrofit kit as an accessory can be displayed in showroom and left to buyers to opt for, does I sound innovative campaign for Kia, I received delivery on 31st August HTX Petrol NA variant and have done 18K kms so far.
Kia;Seltos;9 Jun 2020;Krishna Kanth;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;After a lot of R&D finally got the Kia Seltos HTE Diesel. I must say, I do not regret my decision. It is an absolute delight to drive this baby. The power is more than adequate to skim through Bengaluru city traffic and out on the highway, you just put your feet down, Seltos does the remaining. Overtaking is never a problem even if you are at speeds over 120 KMPH. Overall a value for money package .
Kia;Seltos;17 Nov 2020;Akshat Pokhr..;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;Got myself a GTX+ 1.4 Turbo manual a month back. First free service done today. So far the car has been amazing, be it performance or comfort. Comes packed with features, and it makes you fall in love with all of them.Only disappointing factor is that it scored just 3 stars in global NCAP crash test, which is terrible considering that Tiago scored 4 and Nexon scored 5 stars.
Kia;Seltos;18 Jun 2020;Guru Karkera;5.0; Family Car ;I booked the Kia seltos HTX BLACK COLOR even before it was launched, but I got the delivery only in Feb as the black color was not available as per the dealer. I booked the car for its looks, Interior and features it offered, however I am very satisfied with its drivability and responsiveness. I saw a huge bump in performance after my first service. Great Family SUV.
Kia;Seltos;1 Sep 2020;Keshav Rana;3.0; Daily Commute ;Bought the Seltos Petrol 1.5 last year. The mileage in the city is 10 kmpl. The car has good styling in the front, but looks pretty bland from the rear end. Engine feels refined, but not very powerful as the 1.4 turbo. Also suspension is on the stiffer side. But would suggest new buyers to also have a look at the Hyundai Creta now. Its suspension is better
Kia;Seltos;24 Nov 2020;Sandeep Masih;5.0; Daily Commute ;I'm driving 1.5 petrol ivt.Done 6000km.Absolute pleasure driving in both city n highway conditions.Mileage is around 13.5-14 kmph in city with ac n goes upto 17kmph on highways if you drive in range of 90-110 speed.If you cruise at 90 it'll go upto 20kmph mileage.Super comfortable front n rear seats.Sturdy road grip n fim steering.Love my car.
Kia;Seltos;8 Feb 2020;Ashok T;4.3; Family Car ;I took delivery of Kia seltos htk plus desiel automatic it is really good I drove from Bangalore to chikmagalur the journey was good driving pleasure is nice on the whole the vehicle is good and one more thing to add the Kia people should have put the Kia emblem on the grill it would have been nice.
Kia;Seltos;22 Nov 2019;Dhaval Thoda;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car;SELTOS IS A PERFECT CAR FOR CITIES AND TOURING AS ITS NOT TOO HUGE NEITHER SMALL. ITS A SILENT CAR WITH AN AVERAGE PICK UP. I HAD A HYUNDAI VERNA TRANSFORM WHICH HAD THE BEST PICK UP IN ITS SEGMENT, SO I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. BUT OVERALL EXPERIENCE TILL NOW IS GOOD AS ITS JUST 2 WEEKS OLD.;)
Kia;Seltos;8 Oct 2020;Piraj Mondal;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;The looks is what attracted me the most along with all the features specially the uvo connect feature.Seats are quite comfortable. Very refined and silent engine.There is no lag in power although the turbo variant does a great job in terms of pick up.Overall it's a value for money car.
Kia;Seltos;24 Jul 2020;Parag Mahadik;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Using it for 11 months now. I bought HTK+ petrol model. Car drives great. Nice handling better than my Honda city. Great milage I get 16. Specious fits three people in the rear seat comfortablely. I do miss climate control though. The HTK+ pickup is low, a turbo would have been nice.
Kia;Seltos;28 Sep 2020;Chandra Prakash;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;GTX DCT petrol, just reached 600km and find out to be very handy in handling, driving comfort is next level, 360 camera helps you to reverse the car even in narrow streets, HUD is something special and blind spot is amazing. bit concern about the milage.
Kia;Seltos;7 Dec 2020;Sudev Nair;5.0; Family Car ;Seltos gives a comfortable and stable drive on high speed in the highways.No vibrations on high speeds.Even while applying breaks you have full control of the vehicle.Gives an overall mileage of 17.5 in highways and 15.5 in the city.

Volkswagen;Polo;23 Sep 2019;Rajath Kiran;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It's been 5 Years I have been driving this car. You get to used to it so much ,that you start feeling the other cars are not up to the mark. Not to mention, quality, the heavy yet light to handle, easy manoeuvring, safety are the best features. You may feel the mileage to be a little low in the city, but when you hit the road, easy 22-23 kmpl when you maintain speed of 100-120kmph. But you may dro p down to 19-20kmpl over 140kmph. I personally have touched 170kmph easy till now and the control it awesome.When I first thought of buying it, was a little sceptical, but now.. believe me, if I change I may go back to the same as it"s sets your expectations to a standard, and you, without realising will start expecting the same quality and standards in other cars. Thank you Volkswagen for this go to car. Expect your golf in India soon.
Volkswagen;Polo;1 Apr 2020;Surajit Mohanty;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;i have been using the car since last 7 year and particularly since last three year my daily commute is around 100km/day. car was run so far 75k km and most of the 90% driving done through country side road like pot holes,speed breaker,ups and downs. Vehicle handling,control and comfort in this road was good. indeed my driving was bot rough, so i have replaced the shocks system in FR and RE as well . Mileage i am getting it 15.5km/liter for petrol. Maintenance in service center is bit disappointing as cost is overly priced. So go far outside garage and use the spare from Boodmo which will help to reduce the cost... rest all are okay. So far i am looking far a change but unable to get a replacement for POLO.
Volkswagen;Polo;2 Jun 2020;Gopal Krishna;2.0; Family Car ;Recently I mate with an accident with one dog in the NH16, my Radiator, Carrier, Grille, Vent, Coolant leakage, it has cost 17K in the showroom and after I got repaired in VW Showroom in Vijaywada after 50 km drive again my car temperature increased to 125 Centigrade and now some issue in Engine due to leakage of Coolant in the engine. And the day before yesterday I handover my vehicle to VW Visak hapatnam showroom and now they are giving an estimation of around INR 3 lakhs 39 thousand. I am fully fed up with this vehicle and the company. Someone can help me to know how much will be the cost to repair the engine?
Volkswagen;Polo;16 Sep 2019;Vijay Sachdeva;5.0; Family Car ;Outstanding. Driven almost every hatchback, but found polo is best. People says its service cost is on higher side. I have not found such issues with my polo. And if you have to spent 2 or 3 thousand rupees extra annually.i think its nothing to lose.Build quality of this car ride. Handling.comfort.5 stars. Only con i found is a little noisy. Otherwise go for polo. Best ever mini car for your famil y.
Volkswagen;Polo;17 Sep 2020;Dhvinay PV;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;A comfortable vehicle with a good plush interior despite getting the lowest variant. The vehicle is generally expensive to maintain, both service-wise and spare-wise, so take this into account if planning to get a VW car. The car is built complicated- so if expeditions are expected, the risk of a local mechanic not being able to help you creep home in case of any failures is high.

Volkswagen;Vento;4 Jan 2021;Sabyasachi R..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Highway mileage is always 22+ at a speed of 100-110 with 4 adult occupant and ac on.However, City mileage is around 12.5 with single occupant.Average is ~ 15-16 for diesel with 50-50 usage.Ac blower and cabin light switches are of poor quality and keep on breaking over time; and are expensive to replace these minor things.Steering mount switches are not functional after 5 years of usage.No other q uality issue.Getting rattling noise from front wheels and i can feel the instability on paddles as well, On rough roads.This is happening from last 2.5 years and service center guys are not able to identify the issue or fix it.Someone says frame welding is broken, Someone else says suspension needs replacement, Someone says the rubber padding on top of suspension are bad, But nothing is helping it out.The issue gets fixed only for 10-15 days after each servicing.Highspeed stability is good and even there is lots of power to overtake at high speed.Steering controls are good.Boot space is well managed to fit in a family luggage for a month - 4 big size trolleys and few more smaller bags.
Volkswagen;Vento;2 Oct 2020;Appunni Bala..;3.7; Family Car ;Its purely a driver's car, don't expect anything more from its. when you r behind the wheel you can feel that surge of power and that give you so confident to give throttle. Breaking system and vehicle stability is awesome. steering is equally weighed that can add on your confident at higher speed. And the best part is if you wish to overtake some vehicle you don't have to think twice just give th e command and it follows you.
Volkswagen;Vento;11 Jun 2020;Satishkumar ..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Driving experience is ultimate 👌 Feels very safe either in city or highway.Mileage is as expected goodComfortable seats, features list is not long but all essential band useful features available, which you will never regret of selection.Ample Boot space with easy handling of luggage height provided.Fuel tank i think segments large with 55Liters.

Volkswagen;Vento20152019;5 Dec 2020;Dr;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;The vehicle delivers close to 16 km mileage with 4 people and speed of 100 km/h on high way with heavy luggage.In city, May be around 10 km per liter.Excellent pick up and handling.Very safe car.Strong body.I have been parking my car next to sea shore, Still it hasn't shown signs of rust.Till date it did not invite much of maintenance cost (done 34000km only in 4 years).But, If something breaks in side the cabin ( plastic parts) like switches and all, Its very difficult to get them replaced.You wont get it! other wise it is an excellent car.Authorized service stations are few.Do not go for it of you aren't near any sow room service stations.I would also suggest not to meddle with any of its sensors and electrical systems like, Fitting extra lights etc.
Volkswagen;Vento20152019;1 Feb 2019;Shubh S;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have the vento automatic-my second vento - a gr8 and power packed vehicle. 1.5 litre diesel automatic TDI engine just makes it the top of the line sedan. Feature and comfort-wise the car is gr8. Driving this powerpacked car is a lot of fun but the only sudden problem is the mileage issue - the mileage has suddenly reduced after the first service check - dont really know what the problem is but e xcluding this issue - the vehicle is running perfectly. I do1 a lot of intercity driving so mileage on the highway is not an issue -approx 20 and #25 if drive @80-100kmph (self tested) City mileage approx 13-15kmpl.

Leg space,boot space,luggage space everything is GREAT and music system is also very good.The negative point is only that it have only 2 airbags in highline model,but it"s powerful body can bear anything. After sales service of this car is not so appreciabl e.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;19 Aug 2020;Jknaidu;3.7; Daily Commute ;It is a driver's care. We are 100 percent happy. We are extremely happy about it. The auto transmission DSG is ultimate . If mileage is another 2 to 4 km more then no car can beat it. We have duster,Ford Figo and Honda City Diesel. But my favourite choice is POLO GT TSI always .. For total family.

Volkswagen;Polo20152019;10 Aug 2019;Siva Prabhu;3.3; Occasional Commute ;I gifted to my wife.Expensive car and high maintenance cost.If they want to fight with Hyndai or Toyota then seriously they must reduce maintenance cost.No issue of 5 years 56k drive.Very smooth but 3 cylinder lack sudden pickup!!!!!which feels very bore.Once get cruise,awesome.I reached even 150 kmph nothing feels...no vibration.Cons : A/c feel very down and mileage if u drive more than 120,u wal let will be thin.A Simple 4 seater family car to drive for city and 200 km long drive.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;6 Nov 2020;Abhishek Lal;5.0; Daily Commute;The Polo is one of the most iconic and fascinating car I've ever come across in this particular segment. Its an honour to have one. Mine is 3rd stage remapped and it goes superb with this car model. The dynamics are equally, significantly and overwhelmingly exceptional.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;18 Apr 2019;Sachin Shende;4.7; Daily Commute ;Owns a tdi and the car is Typically German... Built like a tank drives like an airplane.Easy to drive through tight spaces but let the tiny stance not fool you as this car can do some serious speeds which could shame even a couple of sedans above it"s segments add the precise handling and in the right hands she"s gonna cruise like a torpedo :)Love the built quality which is above par with the segm ent and a few segments above.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;23 Jan 2019;Mayur Satish;3.7; Daily Commute ;Polo gt tsi-- the car don"t have a great mileage and as u drive in sport mode performance is at high level but mileage disappoints. Comfort is Best in class. It"s made up of high quality finish and material. Finally it is a German car so safety & comfort, built quality is the best at it"s level. But you have to sacrifice for price maintenance and efficiency it is one of the best premium hatchback in India.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;11 Dec 2019;Saurabh Sharma;3.0; Daily Commute;Its fun to drive car, not for tall people surely, not enough space in rear seats, not enough power in the engine... Accelerates slowly, but very stable at high speed, feels like full of confidence while driving a polo
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;15 Jan 2019;Vansh Singh;4.0; Daily Commute ;Pros -Safest car in the price range , sophisticated styling and good performance.Cons - Spare parts are rare . WORST PART - car relies heavily on ecu and pcm , the fault codes are misleading and if you get stuck , you are doomed to be hopeless!Overall - Good for 5 years , post that sell the car ASAP , or be ready to have mechanics at your speed dial and browser history full of TDI forums !
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;23 Aug 2019;Farook Muhammed;4.3; Family Car ;The vehicle has very good stability & ride comfort. The main drawback with the Petrol manual model is its 3 cylinder engine & rear legroom. Otherwise the VW Polo is a VFM vehicle.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;14 Feb 2019;Muhammed K;3.3; Daily Commute ;The polo which I have is POLO highline petrol , full loaded. The exterior and interior are superb , It has good control even in thr high speed drive.But am not satisfied with the power delivery and milage. The bhp is belly 80, which means the car will struggle to speed up. And the average milage for me is 10km / Ltr to 11.5 km / Ltr.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;20 Jul 2019;Raju Manne;4.3; Occasional Commute;Polo is awesome vehicle with little high cost on maintenance. It cannot be compared with any other car in this segment.

Volkswagen;Ameo;23 Nov 2020;Dharmendra D..;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;This is 4th year of my ownership.My usage has been limited to just over 23k kilometers during these years.Mostly used on long road trips between 300 to 2400 kilometers, Experience is rated at 3.5 actually, Out of 5.Simply for the maintenance cost which has been on a higher side.The model, Even though not well received by suzuki obsessed fellow indians, Does have believers like me.Feel the safest w hile driving.Have done sharp bends at 100 kmph leaving honda cities and innova behind.Never ever felt unsafe with this vehicle.Response to acceleration, Braking is little slow however, This is compensated on steep hill terrains where i don't even have to pull down to 4th gear at times.
Volkswagen;Ameo;30 Oct 2020;Khiladaexpro..;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours ;It is a performance car for individuals into sheer love for driving.Not at all a family car, Okay in comfort for backseaters, Superb comfort for the driver seating.If you wanna go for a beast car which gives you an experience of enthusiast for the love of driving, Then this car is for you ( go for dsg for the pleasure of racing on indian roads ).You can easily do 185 to 200, On highway, You won't know anything till 160, After 160 you would feel a bit fast on india expresss highways on speed breakers.As indian roads are never made for sheer love for driving cars, Just made for normal usage.And if you can't give around 12000 for service, Then this car is not for you, Because of performance you need pay such amount for service.
Volkswagen;Ameo;21 May 2020;Arun Prasad;3.7; Family Car ;Volkswagen ameo is absolutely top in performance and comfort. When features increase obviously there will a lag in milege. So mileage is less when compared. But comfort, style, features, everything else are top in segment. Cruise is one of the best in segment. Then power of engine. Then interiors, alloy wheels, tyres are just top. No words to describe. Best of it.

Ford;EcoSport;8 Jan 2021;Abhiraj Jit;3.7; Occasional Commute ;The ford ecosport is an absolute beast in the sub compact suv segment because of it's great safety and performance.Safety is uncompromised on the car and it's build quality is better than many of it's rivals like the kia sonet, Hyundai venue and the maruti vitara brezza.Mileage on the car is not great because it's nearly 7-9 kmpl but it doesn't matter very much because the ecoboost is absolutely p henomenal engine in terms of performance.When the car is reved at high rpms, The whistling is like an aeroplane and it cannot be called an underpowered engine.Comfort level is not as great as the urban cruiser which is actually the vitara brezza but still it's okay as the ecosport is an enthusiast's car more than a family car if the ecoboost is preferred.
Ford;EcoSport;20 Jan 2021;Vinay Prasad;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Its a real suv feel inside the car, Lovely for long drives, Excellent steering control on highways and in city too.Mileage in city is around 16.5 kmpl and on highways is 21 kmpl.Looks are understated and the feel amd spaciousness inside the cabin is very good, With a sporty dashboard and consoles.The cabin air filter is very nice as it blocks most of the dust and keeps the interior clean.Really im pressed and would definitely recommend ford ecosport.

It is far better than Toyota Fortuner (which is overpriced) in every aspect, be it performance, comfort, refinement, feature and off-road abilities. Only thing I hate is by giving it a 2.0 Litre engine, Ford has taken away the bragging rights it had with the older much powerful 3.2 Litre engine. Great highway runner and easy to ride in the city as well. It is worth e very penny Ford asks for it.
Ford;Endeavour;25 Jul 2020;Jaswinder Singh;4.3; Tours ;I am having 4x4 Thunder Plus model. As it is used for only long tours, I am very happy with this vehicle.

It is still all original except battery and tyres.

Ford;Figo;12 Apr 2019;Milw Aukee;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Model 2013; Figo Titanium 1.4 litre DuraTorq Diesel. Clocked 75K kms till date.Car is pretty robustly built and is reasonably engaging to drive. And there ends the good things about the car.After-sales services are the worst with Ford. Spare parts are extremely expensive and service centers have damaged my car multiple times when given for periodic maintenance !! E.g., once they broke the rear lef t side ABS sensor. Another time they broke the plastic cowl beside front bonnet. Another time, they broke the hood latch handle (plastic). Yet another time, they screwed up the ECU (after some update) that, while driving back from service center, the car went into limp mode. Another time they screwed up the wheel alignment (after suspension replacement). Once they misplaced the carpet and till date never bothered to give me a replacement or pay me money! Once they painted the front left fender and it had a massive over spray!Once I was overcharged by 1800 Rupees and settled that during another visit to same service center 2yrs later!!Mind you, all of these were from different Ford service centers across South India. Not a single one gave me a 10/10 service in the first attempt.
Ford;Figo;18 Jan 2021;Ramraj J;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Overall i like my car as this was my first new car, After 7.5 yrs(67, 000 kms) still feel like new car when car comes back from service no vibrations or no worn out feel inside the car, Very good sound system, Mileage is ok i am getting 15km in city for my style of driving, This was the vehicle which comes with full packed features for less cost in that segment when i bought, Some cons are there y ou will feel lag in highway when you suddenly applies break, Poor ground clearance, Ford service is good but you wont get bills very cheaper as they mention in tv adds i have all 7yrs service bills.

Maintenance costs are reasonable and to say the actual quality of the car itself is very strong and sturdy so need not worry about the safety.For the mileage part, I receive almost around 23 kmpl on highways and around 18.5 kmpl on mixed day to day commutes.The styling is something I am in love with but wish I could have some projector headlamps and DRLs to go with it.A bit sad about the lack of accessories available from the company and 3rd party vendors. Doesn't seem much popular among them.
Ford;Figo;9 Dec 2020;Suraj Nanda;4.7; Family Car ;I call it a budget rocket.Figo 1.5 is the best car in all aspects.Best in the class engine, Superb mileage 22-24kmph with ac on.Very low maintenance and first-class ford service.Powerful and frugal.Best handling in the segment.A strong body ensures a safety turbocharged engine.Awesome interiors and an awesome audio system.Worth every penny you spend on it.Cons: to improve: seat split, Boot space, Alloy for a spare tire, Digital display, Android auto, Little more ground clearance.
Ford;Figo;15 May 2020;Surya Sandeep;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Very practical car.....it's like planted to the road..... even at 150 speed you don't feel any vibrations......thought of changing of car, but there is no such car available. Figo deserves 5 Star ratingaround 3500 is the yearly maintenance (regular servicing).... My scooter (hero pleasure) costs me around 6000 maintenance per year and it gives a max of 20-25 kmpl..... Compared to scooters nowadays car maintenance is very easy
Ford;Figo;17 May 2020;Sai GouthamK..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The best hatchback of India but the most underrated one even. Handling is way ahead of all cars in this segment even mileage is decent with the low maintenance cost what it lacks is ground clearance which is very important for Indian roads but the second Gen Figo has got good ground clearance. Overall I have a very good experience with this car I drove 60k till now I haven't faced any major issues till now
Ford;Figo;28 Aug 2020;Haja Mohideen;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;One of a best car from ford, peppy engine and excellent driving dynamics. Dealership services is not so good. Do not buy extend warranty. The car doesn't have any flaws it'll runs upto 100000kms with simple PMS maintenance. 50000kms so far no any original parts replaced. After factory warranty don't bring it to dealership service, just service somewhere trusted garage.
Ford;Figo;12 Apr 2020;Anshul singh;4.7; Occasional Commute ;A good car for city rides and a great car for highways. Mileage in the city is meager 11-12kmpl but on highways you may get around 15-18kmpl. Performance and safety wise it's better than the rest of the cars in the segment. Handling is great on high speed without any vibration. Feature loaded car with styling and looks. Overall a great package in the price segment.
Ford;Figo;3 Mar 2020;Bedanta Phukon;3.0; Daily Commute;Had one of my worst experience on service from OEM Customer Care. They often try to make us fool.

I had to communicate with Top Management in loop to resolve the issue.

When on the road, you will feel that you are driving a heavy vehicle which loves the road. Build quality is good, top notch with TATA. A biker hit my car from left side and astonishingly, no dent, no scratch what else you can expect in terms of safety. As of now, I got only 18KMPL of average on highways and 14.5 KMPL in city but who cares it when you are certain that you are in a good build car. Life is more precious than average specially with family.Ford has enhanced the car in terms of look and inside it feels premium. Every car has pros and cons so it has. But, I like the car and I feel safe inside it and nothing else matter to me except life.

Ford;Freestyle;1 Sep 2020;Gaurav Sharma;4.3; Daily Commute ;The driving experience of this car is awesome. I use to drive a Hyundai car. But its steering feels masculine. The power to mileage ratio is also very balanced. Obviously you won't get a mileage like Maruti but after all you are driving a Ford. It's much much safer than driving a Maruti. Being a CUV (they call it) it's not ultra comfortable but moderate comfort is there in longer drivings. But pow erful engine subsides all the complaints.You should go for it

As much as I love this car, I am not a fanboy. Look! At 8 lacs, this car stops making sense! The ride quality is good and driving pleasure is unbelievable for the price point. In fact, if you compare it with i10, i20, tiago, swift, etios, and brio, its the best overall package. If you compare it with the ba se variants of Nexon and ecosport, you"d be a fool to buy freestyle. Buying the base variant is that important!

Take anything its the best - highest water wading capacity (REQUIRED in baroda 😂) , looks , power , SAFETY , fe atures are not too tacky but all available are useful in daily times , mileage , ground clearance, We recently took our Fordy out in the diwali from baroda - ajmer - jaipur for 5 days and 2400 kms we just had to refuel (full tank ) it just twice for 3200 rs each. first full tank from baroda on the first day and the second one while leaving from Jaipur and we came back home in half tank pending . means 4800 was the fuel price for this trip gave us close to 22-23 KMPL. Totally worth it . i planned to buy a venue for me now this Feb'20 but why would i if i have uska baap at home ❤ ?
Ford;Ecosport20152021;20 Jan 2020;Narasimha Pr..;4.7; Family Car;I bought titanium plus automatic model.I was very impressed with the safety features but was worried about the mileage part, as almost all reviews said , poor mileage.. around 8 km in city drive and about 10-11 km on highway.. since my usage was limited , took the risk and bought it. Now. I am pleasently surprised to note that the mileage I am getting is much higher. In city bumper to bumper traff ic with AC on, I am getting around 10 , and with moderate city traffic the mileage is around 11-12. However on highway I got 15 km with AC on.. which is very good considering it is an automatic transmission. I have driven about 2000 km and keeping the RPM around 2000-2500, as it is still engine run in phase. It depends on the driving pattern as well and I switch off the engine if the wait for green signal is more than 60 second, probably it helps.
Ford;Ecosport20152021;6 Jul 2020;Garima Gautam;3.0; Daily Commute ;I purchased Ford Ecosport on 14th Feb 2020. Soon after the purchase, noises has been coming from different sides of the car. The dashboard, the four side doors, and even from the back, it keeps making non continuous noises. These noises are causing me irritation and distraction while driving. I got car's first service at 3000km which was a little late due to nationwide lockdown. Even after the ser vice, noises/ sounds keep coming from either parts. The sounds sometimes stop coming own their own and sometimes don't stop at all. Its very troublesome and extremely annoying. I purchased Ford car because it has been reviewed as good quality/ heavy material built car but I am highly disappointed and unsatisfied with it. My experience with the Ford is a drastic let down.

Ford;Fiesta;29 Apr 2020;Average Gamer;3.3; Family Car ;What can i say about my 2009 ford fiesta classic? Well it was a killer in the departments of looks. It was way ahead of its time(looks of car in my opinion). The car is basically a driver centered car as it is well equipped with hydraulic power steering, a good throttle response. Overall a good commuter for daily job. If I remember most of the cars from that time lacks the electronically adjustabl e ORVMs and rear defoggers which was offered in my car. Well the car was a steal for its money. That's why this model of ford was sold more in numbers. This car came out in many different limited edition variants with spoilers and a lots of enhanced good looks with the different colours.Tbh the car has lack of safety equipments.My Ford fiesta classic with the l.6l petrol engine is my childhood friend which my father passed onto me and now what i drives. Lots of memories in it. I'm sure that it is not gonna leave our family anytime soon.
Ford;Fiesta;2 Apr 2020;Adal Arasan;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Most reliable car, it's mileage and driving dynamics are awesome. Really good for hill driving and city cruising. ONLY DISADVANTAGE is, will get irritating injector knocking noise inside cabin when the speed crosses 110 km/hr. I have gone for two long drives 2000+km each.Madurai - Bangalore - Mantralayam - Nandyal - Srisailam - Chennai - MaduraiMadurai - Bangalore - Kukke Subramanya - Sringeri - M ookambika - Murdeshwar - Udupi - Dharmasthala - Bangalore - MaduraiDid't felt much tired and it was really fun to drive car.Thanks!

Renault;KWID;19 Jul 2020;Hydmoto Vlogs;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Overall 4.3/5 The car is compact and suitable for a family for 4 for city rides comfortably. You can zip In and out of traffic happily. Compared to eon and alto or the new maruti espresso this is much more stylish and has mini SUV like stance. Steering is sporty, has adequate comfort. Mileage is excellent at 22-25kmpl. AC is also good. Lighting can be upgraded for highway driving. Not much body ro ll. The 2019 + models get much more engine refinement and cabin noise insulation and the car is pretty much silent. Overtaking suddenly with load may be a little disappointing In the 800Cc model as it is little undepowered which is expected since the displacement is lower at 800Cc.Cons : stiffer suspension, body rattle if not properly maintained. Not suitable for high-speed due to light weight and average breaking.

Renault;KWID;18 Sep 2020;Pranab Sarkar;5.0; Family Car;Renault Kwid is much much better than Alto for the following reasons...1) Better Stylist 2) Better Millage3) Better Interior space4) Better Boot space5) Better Comfort 6) Better Wheel Size7) Better Ground ClarenceAll others features of Renault Kwid are same as in Alto

Renault;KWID;7 Feb 2020;Mohan Kumar;3.0; Family Car ;Comfort is there in travel. As it is 800 cc, running ghat roads is difficult. Mileage committed by the company 25 km/Ltr, the meter shows as 16.2 or 16.30 km/Ltr.Fuel tank shows wrong reading. In one year of purchase, the door handle damaged.

People who is looking first small family car they can go for it.Now lets talk about bad points1. car build quality is on lighter side2. In higher speed around 120 to 140 you can feel that breaking system need to improve more3. Also engine noise is bit annoyingApart from that after sales services is reasonable.
Renault;KWID;15 Nov 2019;Jana Jana;4.3; Family Car ;Good for small family.. mileage depends upon driving skills..Little bit noisy engine.. steering and gear shifting is smooth..Best competitor for alto and eon..

Renault;Triber;26 Sep 2020;Amit Naithani;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Completed around 5 thousand kms on this car.. I own a bs6 manual rxt...on road price in noida was 7.24 in Feb 20...driven on highways, hills of uttarakhand, in noida city in traffic. In city I am getting mileage of around 14 on highways it increases to 19.. it cruises smoothly on highways.. very stable even at high speeds of 120+ except for the slight body roll. I took it max to 140. It however ta kes time to reach top speeds and is not the quickest of the cars.. but I don't mind it much... Ride quality is very good and it feels quite comfortable even on rough terrains thanks to the good suspension and high ground clearance.. on hills too I drove it with 6 people on board and it climbs up without any issues.. however the engine note is loud when I rev it too much.. due to three cylinder engine I suppose. the interiors are pretty nice .. infotainment console , air-conditioning all is perfect with vents in all three rows! The all digital instrument cluster is very useful and intuitive.. the gear shift indicators, door open warning, lights on warning all are very useful.. next coming to space its a king of space after you remove the third rows completely.. I could fit in two adult size bicycles on my recent trip which was so much fun later on.. imagine going on a trip with your bicycles with you in your car.. unbelievable.. now coming to the cons... I don't like the door locks which are like from the first generation cars.. and the antenna which looks too long but we can certainly remove if we don't need.. the car shudders in reverse gear if there is a slight slope and you need to give more throttle to avoid that... I think we need to get used to the car clutch setting and understand it to get the best out of it...and the AC fan noise is loud from outside.. you won't know it from inside but someone outside will certainly hear the noise the ac makes...Rest all is good.. I must also say that noida sector 62 staff is very courteous and I have no complains so far.. my first service was totally free and so far the car has been loyal and touch wood I have not faced a single issue.. I think anybody who is not too performance savvy can go for it..
Renault;Triber;14 Nov 2019;Sushant Main;5.0; Occasional Commute;Renault Triber is an exciting car, I purchased it on 10th Nov 2019. For RXZ Model with 15' Tyre it cost me Rs. 8.11 Lakcs on road in Mumbai. (Paid Rs. 5,500/- extra for the Tyre upgrade)It comes with essentials features like Reverse Camera, 2nd and 3rd row Air Condition vents, infotainment system with Apple Carplay and Android Auto, key-less entry, DRLs, etc. What more can you expect at this price ?Why Renault Triber?We are a family of three, at times my parents joins us and occasionally it is my brother's family. So we wanted a car which can accommodate 6 people and 2 kids for occasional travel. Triber gives me a flexible option of converting it from 5 seater to 7 seater when we have extra family members. I wanted a big family car with basic to advanced features, if you compare it with competition, you would have to shell out 10+ lakh rupees easily. Triber gave me a good balance between budget and expectations. It also gives my family an option to travel together instead of traveling in two different cars.Which features I miss in Triber?1. Automatic Climate Control2. Automatic TransmissionThese features are not deal breaker. Renault Triber is coming up with Automatic model, I am assuming that it should have Climate Control as well.Car Performance?Its too early to comment on the car performance, maintenance cost and mileage. I am expecting it to give me around 13 kmpl; I will be in a position to comment on this after the first service.Who should buy Triber?The answer depends on how often you travel with full load of 6 to 7 members. Then you will have to perform cost-benefit analysis. For a family of 5, with couple of members joining you occasionally, I think Triber is the best option at the given price. Is engine power an issue?I do not know (yet). If Ecco can take a load of 8 people then why not Triber?
Renault;Triber;15 Sep 2020;Subham Jayne;1.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Worst car.....in just 3 months i have filed 8 complaints against this car .......I bought it in a new condition and after 2 months it start giving me so many problems like break fail, tyre get cracked at the speed of 40-50kmph, engine get dislocated, engine gets fired up, all of sudden engine stops working in the middle of the road and more over worst customer care services when I called them for a solution they told me that you don't know how to drive, from past 12 years I'm driving the car and they telling me i don't know how to drive.... instead of providing me a solution they just keep on blaming me again and again. Saved my family from a major accident just because of this poor car have so many glitches and faults. The company name instead of Renault should be Re-Fault. Worst Car please don't buy this poor product from a poor company
Renault;Triber;25 Sep 2020;Ashish Kumar;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I bought trier rxe in july 2020 in patna. it is a amazing car with lot of space. engine power is awesome. we went to long trip from triber from patna to Kolkata. triber gives us outstanding performance. we are around 8 peoples with their luggage. triber performed great. patna to kolata is around 600km and triber completes in just 3000rs of petrol. it gives a good mileage as well ac is very powerfu l.i have invested my money in good product. one more thing which i want to share i have wagonr 2015 model as well that is my parent carafter using triber, when i tried wagonr. i fell like it is a toy and very uncomfortable. tirber give me a luxury car fillings.
Renault;Triber;12 Jan 2021;Nitesh S;5.0; Family Car ;I bought renault triber rxz on 08-10-2020 from pps wagholi.My odometer reading was 1200 when we started our first long trip.We had gone from pune to varanasi via ujjain, Bhopal, Sagar, Reva and return to pune via jabalpur, Raipur and nagpur.Total distance i traveled is around 3700 km in twelve days and the driving experience was good.In ghats, Triber performed well.Maximum speed i drove my triber is 120km/h and the car performance was good.Fuel average i got was around 18.3 km/l.Car was performing very good in bad roads also.No complaints till now with the vehicle.With this budget, This car is a good deal.
Renault;Triber;3 Dec 2019;Prasoon Sury..;2.3; Daily Commute;Ghost acceleration in lower gears. When you apply clutch to shift gear from 1st to 2nd and from 2nd to 3rd a lot of your fuel gets burned without your knowledge. This is the key reason for very poor mileage on lower gears 9-10kmpl Search google for Renault Triber real user review Average mileage 9 to 10.5 kmpl to know about 15 issues that I found.If your daily driving condition is in moderate to h eavy traffic or on hilly areas, what you will get will be around 10kmpl. Custom Tuning the engine for optimal performance cannot be done as it requires a software update from Renault.
Renault;Triber;11 Sep 2019;Somashekar R..;5.0; Tours;I did a test drive of the vehicle. Powerful engine. We were 6 people on board, with AC on, pulled easily in 2 gear from 7kmph. 35 to 100+ in 4th gear was also easy. Most important thing is it is not kwid"s 1 litre engine. Its an ENERGY innovation combined with dual vvt. Intelligent gear ratios maintain optimum rpms throught the rev range. Ride and handling is a benchmark. Renault was supplying eng ines to Rolls Royce. In india, Renault-Nissan provide engines to Benz A class vehicle. Think about their potential. Triber is a superb car. Well done Renault
Renault;Triber;8 Sep 2020;Jitesh;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car;Everything is great ❣️ except Mileage and Fan noise. In traffic or bad road conditions (9 KMPL) and on smooth roads or highway (not more than 13 KMPL). Fuel consumption is extremely high. Fan noise is annoying when you power on AC. It can be heard from buildings away. Disappointed with these 2 issues.

Renault;Triber;11 Dec 2020;;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am really happy that I chose Triber RXZ AMT (White) which is unarguably best car in its price segment. This is the most flexible car around. Renault is going to be the next accepted brand in Indian market with Triber and its upcoming cars.
Renault;Triber;7 Jul 2020;FUSE OFFICIAL;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Nice car at this range but if you buy it boot space is very low when all 7seats are full but if you use it as a 5 seater car it will be amazing experience if you go for traveling you will get a sporty feel
Renault;Triber;23 Aug 2020;Shaik Jaha;4.3; Family Car ;Highly good car for City perpous driving maybe Big families or small... only one minuce point that is mileage, I came to know that hardly it gives12to14 kmph in city area & 15to16kmph on high ways

Renault;Triber;1 Jul 2020;Miziuddin Qazi;1.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Not worth even if cheap. noisy engine. cabin vibrations. cracking sounds all around after few days. seat distortion after use. poor cooling. AMT is worst. please avoid. my humble request.

Renault;Captur;14 Dec 2020;Anand Patil;5.0; Daily Commute ;We loved the captur, The day it was launched through ranver kapoor ad.But the price was a bit too high we thought.The look had mesmerized us.And in 2018 renault came up with an offer we could not refuse.Bought the platine model and dealer repainted the top in ivory as my wife wanted at his cost and we were on a trip to jaislemer from mumbai even before first service.Caotur performed very well.The high seating position was a confidence booster after driving hyundai accent for years.Before.Torque was always available when required.And 800 kms a day did not cause any soreness in body.I have fallen in love with my captur and driven it to all corners of maharashtra and recently to patiala.The car gives a decent mileage of 17.5 kms per liter of diesel.Service station is very good and offers pick up and drop services.And as the model is discontinued it becomes pride of a unique car.

Renault;Duster20162019;14 Oct 2018;Soham Khamaru;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Duster is to my notice is the only car that amazed me from Renault family. . I am a crazy driver who loves spending like whole day behind the wheels... I get a lot of confidence in highways espicially attacking corners or city drive when i am in a rush .. my pops bought 85ps rxz model... but 110ps was an if statement.. engine noise is a minimum.. the dashboard looks oldish with black plastics... i nfotec need to be rallied to match the market. bootspace is amazing considering its segment... talking about body outlooks its has simple but muscular outlooks bumps at the front n back secctions of the body where tire protudes..driving over in city all i can say these bumps need to be talken under notice or else scratches might happen .. this what makes me unhappy .. height is adjustable.. one advice if u r driving in highways keep the seat height low to enjoy it better. suspension is good till now to my notice
Renault;Duster20162019;20 Jan 2021;Vignesh Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Maintenance cost are very high. But if you are performance oriented person then this car is for you.

Renault;KWID20152019;29 Mar 2019;Suvin Kumar;1.0; Daily Commute ;Iam a recent buyer of Renault Kwid AMT and bought it to gift my wife.All the booking were done as we were convinced of the service and effort taken.But on 25th March 2019(delivery date) things changed really bad when I arrived to get the delivery of my car-1) As I was waiting in the longe finishing the formalities ,I noticed a staff showing our car like a demo car to a new customers. The customer" s kids got in the car and spoiled the interior . When asked on the situation , they said its normal. I demanded that I get my car cleaned again for which they had done a very shabby job.-2) I got into my car to check the features, I found out that the Apple car play and Android auto that was promised to us is not available in the model given to us, where as Ms Radhika your sales associates promised it to us not once but more than twice. Again all they had to say is sorry.With much reluctance and unhappiness we took he delivery of the car.-3) Once delivered, on road we found out that the light inside the car was not working & infact had a lose contact. We bought the car back to the showroom to rectify it and to get the fast tag sticker done which they apparently forgot and I had to ask them.They said they rectified the light but the same issue continued post the correction. I have a video as proof taken to show the showroom, but as usual everyone was too busy to attend to our inconvenience . There is also a complaint in the meter console as inspite of putting petrol worth 2000 rs , the milage and indication of petrol dropped to almost empty within less than 10km of drive. Milage shown was 7km/l. On complaining all these, they promised to pick up the car from our house to rectify it, but even now the pickup has not been done . And they are forcing us to register the car, Why should we?This is not our first car and we own other brand as well. But we are highly disappointed at what happening and really sad that they have no care attitude towards us.-The customer service at the TVS & Sons, Renault Maradu,Kerala is beyond bad and never expected this before buying ,- We expected Renault to keep up a standard-Promise are done from the sales consultant to the sales managers. Why promise and commit when you cannot keep it?- It is our money and emotions involved. Is the service only till the car is booked by giving false promises?-Past sales we don"t even have human consideration.Never expected this from a brand like Renault.Waiting for at least a positive response from the customer service teamWith much regret
Renault;KWID20152019;11 Aug 2019;Neha Arora;1.0; Daily Commute ;Its a pathetic car and worst service people also. I recently bought this car. As its my first car i thought i should buy new one because i don't want to face any problem which usually happened with second hand car on a regular basis so i took the decision to buy a new one but in 4 months i visited the service 5 times for repairing my new car. It doesnt matter it is in warrenty because for me my ti me is very pricious and why should i have invested in new car if this kind of problem is happening, again and again, it is still not repaired yet. From the first month AC problem, average issue and automatic stop on highway issue happened. Today again someone picked for AC repair and again they said it will take 5days to correct the issue. Its height now they gave me a defective car and they have to replace it now otherwise I will take legal action against them its my hard earn money and i will not accept this defective car. same service centre people are not able to fix it till yet how i can believe again and what about my time my patience

Renault;KWID20152019;21 Jul 2019;NH42 Auto;3.3; Occasional Commute;First of all, Kwid is all about budget and mileage oriented vehicle.Do not expect for safety and performance and make sure you will be using it for city use as it is designed for city conditions.Pros:Mileage.Comfort within speed limit of 100kmph.Less maintenance.Touchscreen navigation with Bluetooth connectivity.Bootspace.Body design.AC.Cons:Gage is not good.(Even touched with stone or pressed har d, chances of getting dent and damage is more)No Safety,Which must be prioritized.No rear power windows.No rear speakers.No mirror adjustment knobs from inside.Comfortable only for 4 people.Wheel is having just 3 bolts, but entry level hatch back like eon, Alto has 4.Suggestion is, if you are a single driver, in need for daily commute or a small family for use within city limits,this will be the best at this price segment and features.As a owner for almost 3 yrs,these are my experience.Think wise and choose.

Renault;Pulse;5 Mar 2020;Kapil K;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am driving Renault pulse from past 5 years. As the technology is allied together with Nissan Micra model. Both are identical in many ways.Pulse really justifies 1.2 litre petrol engine with power pulse. body engine ratio is really balanced showing great performance in city and highway.once i had long drive for around 300km with one short tea break without tiring my backbone. Petrol engine mileag e touched 19.5 once in highway long driving without AC. No doubt that one can achieve good mileage with some driving tips.Low ground clearance has good grip on roads but also annoying when facing pits.ABS is a missing and only negative point i feel considering its a good city car.
Renault;Pulse;27 Oct 2020;Sourabh Sury..;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Renault pulse was underrated car of the segment, I used it for 5.5years, unfortunately due accident I had to do total loss, otherwise the car was powerful,sturdy. Renault should think to relaunch with facelift with same powerfull DCi engine,
Renault;Pulse;17 Sep 2020;Ishan Verman;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;The service cost is quite high due to which overall maintenance cost is more than its peers. In driving the car is great with good acceleration and speed. Very easy to overtake on highways. Has good ground clearance too.

BMW;5Series;10 Sep 2019;Anil Roy;4.3; Family Car ;Over the years I have had the good fortune of owning a variety of brands- Maruti, Hyundai, VW, Skoda, Mercedes and most recently BMW 5 series, which undoubtedly is the best driving experience. I like to drive and the 5 series is sheer pleasure. However, BMW’s dealer in Ranchi is not a shadow of who they represent. Here’s my experience: they started on a high note- unrelenting phone calls until payment was collected. They give me a date to take delivery. Since I live in Jamshedpur (about 170 kms from the dealership), to make sure before arriving, I ask for a copy of Temporary Permit (TP). They go -that’s not done yet but ‘chalte hai’- everyone takes delivery without one. I ask how about insurance cover, God forbid, in case of an accident without TP. They say- that’s your risk! Obviously, I postpone the delivery until the following week when they confirm that TP is done. On the day, after a flimsy ritual of (third class) cake cutting ceremony, they hand me the keys with a photo copy of an un-signed, un-stamped TP! As much as I am aghast, I have no option but to drive a new car with technically no legal paper of registration and ownership. They promise to have the signed copy of the TP sent within 48 hrs, which after 41 days I still haven’t received!Now, here’s the kicker- my TP expired on Aug 29 and the car has no registration; hence a 60 lac car now sits pretty in my garage while I use a Ola to get to work!So in summary BMW ought to do better in their selection of dealership, lest they risk erosion of their hard-earned brand equity. To all the BMW lovers in Jharkhand and Bihar, stay away from Titanium.

It is a personal indulgence and whether for short commutes (well not exactly in NCR where my office is 30 kms away) and long drives, it's a pleasure to drive the car. What has amazed me is its consistent city mileage in excess of 12 kms/liter and highway mileages exceeding 18. Maintenance is expensive. A snipped wing mirror se t me back by 35k; routine service as prompted by the car is hardly less than 15 to 20k. Fortunately there is a growing tribe of luxury car third party service centres that do an equally good job at one third the official ones, at least there are quite a few in Delhi/NCR. Overall, if you have one driving indulgence and stretch your finances - go for the BMW.

It is surprisingly easy to maneuver around bends and make tight U-Turns. The suspension absorbs all bad patches and makes the ride great. One can drive this car all day across the country and not feel tired.The engine has more than enough performance and versatility. In comfort mode, one can enjoy a smooth ride and in sports mode, the car ho lds gears longer and the whole experience becomes sporty.Since there are a lot of Electronics, the maintenance cost can run high if the car is not maintained or put in use. Buy it and use it is the funda here. The car is to be enjoyed and not kept as a showpiece in the garage

Its really flashy, the petrol version (and only the petrol version in GLA) is pretty powerful to give you those driver adrenaline if you want those. The car is very communicative to the driver, and very safe such that a naive or beginner drive r can quickly adapt to driving this car (my wife learnt to drive and enjoys driving my car). It is really safe with a lot of assisting features like the Active brake assist which I love for beginner drivers like my wife (the car senses the urgency to brake and assists in braking on time with the required intensity. On the other hand if I want to race the accelerators in a moment they sense my experienced footwork and lets me do what I want to do with the car. Its really communicative to my driving style. Comfort and styling though lagging in comparison to other higher version Mercedes cars, is definitely a lot more feature rich than the competitors BMW and AUDI. Space issues are there if someone is looking for a family SUV, But trust me I carried a 6 foot long 50kg kickboxing bag in my boot with the rear seats down and front passenger side seat a bit pushed ahead, still two of us me and my wife drove back with that bag. So although space on record and looks are really not so much as you would expect of an SUV, it is doable. Now those who go after style and fun really wont care much about space would they? And rear seats are fairly comfortable but a driver like me who have never sat on his rear seats of the previous cars in the last fifteen years cannot care less about rear seat comfort and spaces. For self the driver, space and comfort is pretty much competitive with peer brands though not as good as the higher versions of Merc which I would like to enjoy.

It doesn't provide command and feel of control over vehicle when using its brakes. Reverse gear drive also not comfortable. boot opener given below driver seat, totally brainless. also, power windows buttons given under hand brake, Japanese car but no brain used here too designing the car. bought though, due to look and budget for automatic, just few Kms (10) drive a day and didn't know these lacking before buying. recommend not to buy, better alternative is celerio but probably 1lac+ more.

You have to wait for a couple of minutes to restart the engine. After a couple of repeating events i took it for service centre (EVM NISSAN,Perinthalmanna,KERALA) and they changed sli p clutch point and programme And gave me assurance that it won"t repeat.But the engine couldn"t keep the promise and gave me a counted 7 times engine break down.3 times in the middle of the road and i was saved due to my lower speed and absence of vehicles behind.Thanks to god.I took it to service station slow and steady by the edge of the road due to fear because the problem is not periodic and comes anywhere anytime.

Nissan;Kicks;1 Aug 2019;Dilip Kumar;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;An excellent car.If you are a looking for a real SUV, then Kicks is the one. The 210mm ground clearance makes it the best fit for off-roading. The suspension is amazing. You wouldn't know about the gutters and pot holes on the road when you are in the Kicks. A sturdy body, wonderful steering, excellent ride quality and a quiet cabin makes it an ideal car for those long drives and City driving as w ell. The interiors are nicely done. The speakers could have been a little better but that's not a dampner. You have the option of customizing it which is something I did and this is an excellent option.Overall a wonderful car.

Gets you average mileage of min 15 kmpl if you drive at 80 kmph.Stable, well balanced. In about 4 years with 45 k - Total cost on service incurred around Rs.50000/-. Some of the flaws in the lining could not be repaired by the service centre.Rear view mirror rattling and sliding down (esp if it is camera mirror) is perennial from day oe and cannot be fixed by the service centre.Difficult to drive in Highway when there is trace of water on the roads during rain. Water splashes on the wind shield and chokes your visibility.Head lights - not bright. - diffculty in driving during night in small roads

Nissan;Sunny;14 Nov 2018;Hanshad Damo..;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Have been driving this Car for last four years. Started with avg mileage of 18 to 20 kmpl. But now after long drives of 150 to 400 km at a stretch and crossing 38000 km, this beauty has started giving 29 kmpl over highways and 23kmpl through city and highways and 16 to 18 kmpl in traffic choking cities.Has enough boot space to accommodate luggage for 3 members for any long trip,including stroller. . Rear seat leg space is big to hold additional luggage in upright position.. When it comes to overtake, just shift to 3rd gear and accelerate.. Feel the punch. Never seen this on honda brv or ciaz(cars I had driven on long trips).I just love it!!! At high speeds, steering gets bit tight giving you extra confidence. Also never felt that I drive a big sedan (in length). Its just driving like a Hyundai eon :). A great car to have.. Just test drive and look for safety features offered in budget price, if you plan to buy one. Only issue is with the dashboard near the steering making rattling sound. Got it corrected on last service but after a month, its back. Thanks to Kerala roads. If you have music playing loud, it shouldn"t matter though.Brakes could have been better like the one in honda brv. Overall a car that gives you adequate power, best mileage, better comfort (though body roll is there on hair pin curves) with safety not at all compromised....
Nissan;Sunny;23 Aug 2020;RAM LAKHAN;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Its a very much comfortable and love to drive car. It has a boot space of 450 liter. Leg space between the back row and front row is too much. Full comfort on long drives. Rear vents are good too. Engine of Nissan is so good that I cant describe it in my words. Its makes your more safe when you drive it on highway and do overtakes. If anyone love sedans then its my prefereable one.

LandRover;DiscoverySport20152020;2 Sep 2019;AMRISH CHOPRA;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;In general it is an excellent car, very well styled but it has a major problem. Its driver seat is very badly designed, I have Discovery Sport HSE 2019 model. It is just not possible to set it to a comfortable position. In long distance driving, seat creates pressure points and restricts blood flow to legs resulting in swelling of feet. JLR refuses to accept the problem. When you sit on the driver 's seat, no matter how much you adjust, knee joint is higher than hip joint, a sure shot recipe for back and leg problems.

Maserati;Quattroporte;1 Jan 2019;Sharad Rajamani;4.7; Family Car | Occasional Commute ;Wow car. Beautiful ride quality. I love the customisable interiors. The comforts and silence in the car is beautiful. Purrs like a kitten. The suspension is just stiff enough to corner at 150+ on certain curves. Hugs the road. Loads of road grip. Styling is like an angry bull (cartoon) for some angles in the front. The tail light cluster is awesome. I love the adaptive cruise control which goes al l the way down to “0”. The early brake warning and override even without cruise control is great!!! The brakes turn super sensitive at this time. The car can literally stop on a dime with its Brembo Ceramics extras. My worry all the time is the guy behind may not stop in time. Despite the alarm tail light flashes.

ISUZU;DMAXVCross20152019;5 Feb 2019;P Ashish;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Give a very strong road presence and stance. Fun to drive. Customization list is long and one should not go in for all mods together rather take your time, investigate,learn, talk and then decide. (One can nor resist building ones mod list ranging from upside tyre, engine remap, bumpers, tonneau cover, lights, bar lights, sports roll bars, interior seats, floor mats, music system, free flow filter s, exhaust, lift, suspension upgrade, canopy, the list just keeps building It is a big truck...so one needs to modify the driving style and parking is a problem...One need not be able to park where one wants to go..so searching parking near where you want to go and then walk is a norm. Can take 5large bodied passengers with ease., highway drive is fantastic not wobbles or lateral sways at any speeds. Can speed up but it is always good to be in control of speed..Indian highways are not for very high speefs ( above 120 as too many people think driving in wrong sides, crossing toads as if in a park, driving slow anywhere in anything is a birth right or a democracy in India provides this a in the constitution - 😉pun intended) Overall..once you ride this...you can not go down to a saloon or a Bach back or a smaller vehicle.Remember this may be your last diesel as the next purchase may not even have a diesel option in the market...

Jeep;Compass;8 Oct 2019;Dr;2.0; Daily Commute | Family Car;I purchased Jeep Compass Limited Plus on 1st of July 2019, and within 15 days (vehicle not even driven 500km out of which 300km on first day) lot of annoying sounds audible from sunroof, dashboard, doors (maybe from C-pillar) and now from suspension. I am in continuous contact with Mr. Mike Manley, Mr. Kevin Flynn, Mr. Mangesh Kodalkar, Mr. Lokendra and their team through email. After approximatel y one month their team came to record video and they accepted the faulty things and they took my vehicle to dealership/ workshop for 7 days and even after that problems not resolved dashboard problems enhanced. I requested them to replace the faulty vehicle they refused. I said the reason behind the request is that the faulty components was installed from company end and not from customer end. Now their team worsen the things and I am forced to go legal
Jeep;Compass;26 Aug 2020;Venkataraman..;4.7; Tours | Family Car ;I am extremely happy with the Jeep Compass 1.4 MAIR DDCT I bought in Feb 2019. I have taken in on long drives to Chennai and Hyderabad. The handling is unparalleled with confidence inspiring manners and stability. The build quality is excellent with built to last feel. I have got 14 kmpl in highway section and 8 kmpl in city. The mileage drops to 6 kmpl in extremely short runs. I sorely miss the C ruise Control feature which, in my opinion, is a significant shortcoming. If FCA can offer retrofitting this feature for a price, I will be first in the queue!
Jeep;Compass;17 Jan 2020;Gagandeep Ch..;4.7; Daily Commute;Diesel 2.0 litre Bs4 engine with manual transmission offers a great performance with strong midrange. There is some turbo lag in low rev. Steering is precise and quick, chassis is stiff, so overall very sporty and enjoyable on highways. For city is also good but slightly heavy clutch. Main thing is tighter cabin space just enough for 4 pax and just enough boot space. Build quality is solid and no squeaks after 20000 km in 1.5 years. Maintenance is every 15000 km and first one costed less than 10K. Overall satisfied
Jeep;Compass;16 Jan 2020;Joydipta Ray;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Very good build quality and plush interiors. Many features not given in the top model for India which is sad. It's pretty zippy when pushed hard. The DCT is sluggish during sudden deceleration and one can hear the shift mechanism hunting noisily. Monocoque chassis makes it's stiff for off road use while keeping the in cabin nosies to a minimum. Remote start and AC, crusty control, electric boot op ening, open door warning lights and passenger seat electric adjust are features that have been missed out 😒
Jeep;Compass;13 Jan 2021;Sree kumar;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Comfortable but not a plush drive, Mileage was as expected, With 12ish when driving for speed, And around 14is for mileage.The engine performance was a delight as expected and the vehicle is really stable even at high speeds and comes to a quick steady stop when braking.

Lexus;LS;18 Apr 2020;Udit Verma;4.3; Family Car | Daily Commute;Hard to beat ride as for as comfort, cabin noise, and reliability is concerned. One could be going 160 Kms/hr and inside car, one does not realize it unless look at speedometer. All the cars made by Toyota (Lexus being luxury brand of Toyota are legendary as for as reliability goes. Lexus does need to catch up with driver assist features and other electronic bell and whistles. I thing its wonderfu l family car for long drives. For daily commute, in some Indian Cities it might be difficult to maneuver and parking etc as it is relatively large car
