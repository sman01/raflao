13 Aug 2020;Abu Baba;3.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;My diesel powered swift 2013 is probably the best hatchback car I have ever owned. The reason I say so is because even after driving it for more than 170000 kms, the car still feels fun to drive. Moreover it is an economic option with less service costs and average fuel economy I get of about 21 kmpl. Moreover Maruti's great after sales service experience, the quality of service/repairs offered an d vast network of service centers really helps. The only time I had to spend some money was in the events of tires and battery replacements. Although there are no high end features to brag about this car, the feature list is simply practical and just enough for a good driving experience. In my view, the only features this car must offer more is wider tires and cruise control. Also, Maruti should offer BS 6 diesel engines in new cars and if this happens, I think swift will be an even more fun to drive car.
5 Jun 2020;Paras Raizada;4.0; Daily Commute;I have clocked 260K KM's in last 10 years with 1.3L Petrol Engine. Just 1 clutch plate change @ 120K KM with tyre change @ every 80K KM's. Only 1 time front and back suspension change and other minor mechanical wear and tear changes. I cannot be happier than this that even after 10 years of life cycle, 260K KM's, its going strong and I believe will be able to clock anywhere around 400K Km's by nex t 2-3 years.I'm addicted to this car and unable to change to new one just because of sheer driving pleasure and ultra low cost maintenance.This car is just amazing......
16 Apr 2020;Shriniket Punde;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The first gen swift is considered as one of the most fun to drive hatchbacks in India . My swift , dispite being a diesel, is no exception . It handles great, has a punchy mid range and decent braking too. The things which it misses-out on are most of the creature comforts which are found even in much cheaper car today. My Swift is a 2011 model year and still, the feature list dates back to the 90 's.I still love the car as it has a soul, a happy and energetic nature which is hard to find in cars now-a-days !
29 Sep 2019;Kowshick N;4.7; Daily Commute ;The swift is an most conveniante an best handling car for the beginers.. It offers more features like push button start, automatic climate control, touchscreen infotainment system and also provides an fun to drive experience to its owners, the millege is phenomenal in this segment I think bcoz it offers 24km millege in highway. Overall it satisfies the all things for beginners. And safety features also implemented in this car ex...ABS, EBD, airbags such I preety excited about this factors of my swift
10 May 2020;Samskrithy;3.3; Family Car ;1. Its a family vehicle. good for city drives. comfy till an extend for a long trips... have traveled a maximum of 9000 km in a strech. 2. the best thing is that it is easy to maintain.. the maintenance cost is low.. everything stays within the budget.3. the negative side is the lag.. seats and the steering wheel.4. mileage is good....pickup for that segment is easy-to-go.....build quality is baad ..... no vibrations till 110-120 kmph.... features are also okay.5. after sale value is high...
20 Jan 2021;Venkateshwar..;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Was a particularly good purchase for its time and did enjoy the comfort for the initial 4 years.Predictability of the vehicle safety and reliability took a big hit by around the 8th year of the ownership, When the thermal sensor broke and spilled the coolant into the engine.The sheer absence of good diagnostic toolkit and a not so commendable service by msm even after 9 years of consistent track r ecord with them, Leaves much to be desired from maruthi :(.
28 Oct 2019;Gourav Rathore;2.0; Occasional Commute | Tours;Not comfortable and not spacious for back seat passengers. I drive only for weekend trips or long trips on highway feel low power or on hills face alot of problem with it compare to my friends Hyundai grand i10 his car performs well and also looks small in size but spacious and have all features like stearing mounted controls and abs all disc brakes and engine performance like pickup and average a lso so good compare to my swift in all way worth it car.
9 Nov 2020;Deepu Pato;3.3; Family Car ;The overall car design and the rigidity are awesome but the problem arises with the safety where the maruti suzuki has not even given the rear parking sensors.The car is not so spacious and the maintenance cost is also so high as compared to the features and all if you ask me to buy this car or not then i will prefer you not to bu this because the car is not at all safe, And spacious.But if you wa nt a car which have a good mileage and a good design.
24 May 2020;Anand Purush..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;i am using swift VDI from 2012. I feel the car performance , maintenance and driving is good . I enjoy driving being in driver seat . cons > - i feel only four adults can accommodate in that car.- ingress /egress in the back seat is horrible; elders will never like it .- Air con is bad; it is just adequate for the front row .. during the peak summer you feel it is not at all sufficient .. - driver seat is not fully ergonomics for people above 5.2

2 Jul 2020;Partha P;3.3; Daily Commute ;The Swift Vxi is reasonably sturdy, but the mileage is something that definitely should have been more. Mileage within the city is approximately 11 to 12 Kmpl and on long drives, it is approximately 16 Kmpl. Lack of airbags and other safety measures is a definite worry. But overall in terms of performance, it has been quite good. Smooth rides with no engine problem in the last six years.
1 Sep 2019;Updates Global;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I purchased new hyundai venue before a week and i was wishing to exchange my 2 years old maruti swift with itself. But after 1 week of driving experience of hyundai venue i realise that it doesn't meets the standard of maruti swift.
6 Jun 2020;Raman Bhardwaj;4.7; Family Car ;I have spent wonderful 4 years with Maruti Suzuki swift ZXI. Driving it was always fascinating. I it was the easiest car to drive. I learnt driving on a old model 3 geared jeep. Then after much consideration I bought swift zxi. Easiest car to drive , no maintenance cost, easy smooth driving. While driving it you get a feel of sports car. Just amazing...
1 Sep 2020;Pranav J;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;The car is good for daily use as its economic and the maintenance is less. The suspension is not very good and ride comfort is average. On the highway its comfortable but hitting a pothole is a pain in the ass. I would not recommend for long ride since the build quality is below average . A small pressure even with your hand on the body causes a dent .
13 May 2020;Anika Dhanan..;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Everything is good when you name mileage, maintenance cost,features safety is good but body shield is an average not a tough body it feels like.seats are not comfortable for long drive.Petrol engine performance is superb as I am driving Baleno RS which is made for performance.All other factors of this car are well satisfactory.
11 Oct 2020;Varun 1955;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;It is a budget sports vehicle i have been owning swift sinec 2009 and i have no major complains all these years and i have never waited for a long time for replacing any spares of the car ,every spares are available everywhere ,even during the the corona lockdown tge spares were available . It is an evergreen vehicle
11 Aug 2020;Rajat Dhingra;2.7; Daily Commute ;Affordable car at this price. If you are concerned about your safety and your family's safety do not go for this car. Every car has some pros and cons same goes with swift. If you r looking for a affordable car at low maintenance cost and you are not concerned about your saftey then swift can be a very good option.
3 Dec 2020;Suresh Chandran;3.7; Occasional Commute;By styling wise.. no car can compete with swift in terms of hatchback category..But performance wise not that much good in highways.. Over noise in engine if we reach 110 or more than that.. not worthy for money when compare with previous version swift.. person who seeking for mileage can for swift blindly..
20 Dec 2020;Kiran Shahasane;3.7; Family Car ;Car build quality should be improved.The dealer should be given 0ne hours to the customer for car inspection at delivery time.I had taken the car delivery on 19th march 2020 from my car vashi, But the dealer did not give this opportunity for car inspectionthis should not happen with another customer.
14 Jan 2020;Pik Singh;3.3; Daily Commute ;We got 17.1kmpl in the city, and 22.6kmpl out on the highway. For a sporty hatch, the Swift rides quite well. But wait, it's a diesel automatic, more likely to be ferrying a family around. Well, in that case, it never truly isolates you or the passengers from what's happening under the wheels
17 Aug 2020;Himanshu Madan;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car;2014 swift vxi seems to lack a lot in terms of safety , the maintenance is kind of pricey on 10k at every paid service , maybe because it's my first time owning a car , but I like the performance , somewhat adequate if you drive it sanely , but best part for me is the design , just love it .
7 Nov 2020;MANI EEE;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;I need non ac car.So need better performace for mileage Engine condition, Quality tyres.Simple ways to get better fuel efficiency without you having to be.Driving with optimal tyre pressure makes a huge difference to your car's fuel efficiency.You'll save more fuel with the windows up.
10 Dec 2019;Jo;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;it's great as always good driving dynamics mileage near20 after first sevice even more legroom more thanks to the position of rear door handle(find it out) but falling of driving a light weight car more on highways tall persons beware to adjust seat you can miss traffic light!!
27 Mar 2020;Zeeshan Nazir;3.3; Family Car ;I own Maruti Suzuki Swift ZDI (2015 model), when it comes to mileage the car is highly fuel efficient but could have been better interms of build quality. Also the safety features could have been better.Comfort level is good but is lagging behind other cars in the segment.
30 Sep 2020;Ashutosh Thakur;4.3; Family Car;I personally likes swift new model , power, looks, comfort everything under a budget .Mileage is a bit issue while driving in city it gives around 11-12 mileage which is quite low and day by day fuel price is rising so it may feel expensive a bit for middle class.
9 Sep 2020;Vikram Tanwar;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;My first car and I love it. It never left me midway, Safe, reliable and zero maintainance. I drove it on Hilly roads, highways and streets, just awesome. On highways its mileage touches 26. Great isn't it? I didn't had to pull out 'jack' even once in 5 years.
7 Sep 2020;Vishak Ramak..;5.0; Occasional Commute ;Very good Overall with maruthi brand and I am very much happy to use this from past 4 years.I would recommend my family and friends side for buying maruthi brand cars.It is overall a good performance brand in terms of mileage, maintenance,car performance,safety.
3 Sep 2020;Nanda Kishore;3.7; Daily Commute ;Single owner (swift VDI) vehicle driven for almost 154000kms.. very much satisfied with the vehicle.. worrying factor is safety.. no air bags and no abs.. no problem as of now still running good without any repairs.. gives a mileage of 20kmpl. Low maintenance.
24 Dec 2020;KAPIL JAIN;1.3; Daily Commute ;I have purchased #marutisuzuki swift and it started rusting from everywhere just like a garbage can.Poor quality.Better buy #tatamotors #hyundai #mahindra.Even the tata nano is much better.No doubt why maruti's market share is collapsing.Htt******152?s=20.

8 Nov 2020;Viswanath Va..;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours ;Purchased this car during initial launch.Wanted to say that it’s good only in terms of mileage.Car body is not much stronger and looks like a thin metal sheet.City rides attracted lots of dents and scrapings due to indisciplined fellow motorists.

16 Mar 2020;Abha Jaiswal;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;It is really a great car despite of its somewhat not latest technology but it could easily compete with the greatest car of our time as a mileage breaker and also with its speed and its low maintenance cost which will shock everyone
