Volkswagen;Jetta;21 Nov 2020;VINOD DUGGAL;5.0; Family Car;I had a Jetta 2.0 Comfortline. Real Comfort always was there. Highway mileage came out to be 24 Kms/Litre Diesel. 8 Airbags, Seat warmers, Decent Defrost for Front & Rear. Driving this car was always a pleasure.All it lacked was a Digital Screen, Mobile Bluetooth etc. In dash Audio was excellent.
