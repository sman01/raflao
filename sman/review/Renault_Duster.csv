Renault;Duster;14 Jul 2020;Kishan Singh;4.0; Occasional Commute | Tours;A great entry level suv. excellent ride quality, handling, control and comfort. only lacks in interior and accessories list which anyways can be fitted later, which I have done. I got fiited new covers, new music system with woofer, parking camera, new headlights and tail lights, tpms, Dash board camera, etccc. overall good value for money in this price range.
Renault;Duster;29 Apr 2020;Sharvan S;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Good looking and powerful petrol engine. Driving comfort is good. Only main issue is rear seat ventilation. Duster is offering AC ventilation to front searter like driver and front seater. Ac is not coming to rear seat. But overall ground clearance is better than all cars. No tension while crossing big speed brakers.

Renault;Duster;13 Feb 2020;Nikhilesh Aw..;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It's a good family car for occasional long tours, due to its petrol version. That's why I bought it. On long tours mileage is quite good about 17 km/liter. Though on short city runs, it's low like 06kmpl, which is expected from big petrol cars.
