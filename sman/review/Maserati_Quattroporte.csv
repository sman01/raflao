Maserati;Quattroporte;1 Jan 2019;Sharad Rajamani;4.7; Family Car | Occasional Commute ;Wow car. Beautiful ride quality. I love the customisable interiors. The comforts and silence in the car is beautiful. Purrs like a kitten. The suspension is just stiff enough to corner at 150+ on certain curves. Hugs the road. Loads of road grip. Styling is like an angry bull (cartoon) for some angles in the front. The tail light cluster is awesome. I love the adaptive cruise control which goes al l the way down to “0”. The early brake warning and override even without cruise control is great!!! The brakes turn super sensitive at this time. The car can literally stop on a dime with its Brembo Ceramics extras. My worry all the time is the guy behind may not stop in time. Despite the alarm tail light flashes.
