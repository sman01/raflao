Tata;Zest;27 Jan 2020;Chetan Mehta;2.3; Occasional Commute ;Previously I had Tata Indigo and that was the Best Car from Tata, so I thought that this new Zest will be better than Indigo, but I am sorry that I am fail and my trust and faith to Tata Motors spoiled. I am travelling by car and I had to go for far distance from My Place Bhuj to Ahmadabad, Baroda, Gandhinagar capital of Gujarat. and other places. I thought that new Zest will be have good Average of Mileage then Indigo !!
Tata;Zest;7 Jul 2020;Rahul Puri;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Small explanation.....It's Much Much Better than Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire ,Just the Comparision where Dezire wins is Mileage and that too by just 3 to 4 km / lt otherwise features ,Comfort , Reliability and all other factors Zest is Far better than Dezire,Can say because Of being pre owner of Dezire which I bought in 2010 and sold in 2014 to buy Zest
