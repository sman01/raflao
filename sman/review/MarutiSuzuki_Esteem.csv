MarutiSuzuki;Esteem;19 Jul 2020;Hydmoto Vlogs;4.7; Occasional Commute ;The best MARUTI car of all time.This is most demanded car for enthusiasts who love to own a classic or modify for drags. The car blows your mind away with how quick it can accelerate and how easy it is to control. It gives you sporty seating position as It is positioned low like the old Honda city. Ac is decent, maintenance is cheap and repairable any roadside car mechanic. Parts are easily availa ble. Pros :Collectors carModification friendlyPerformerEasy maintenanceCons : outdated modelNo safety featuresVery low slung and can scrape speed breakers with load.
MarutiSuzuki;Esteem;29 Feb 2020;Prince;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car;It is a nice car if you want ot buy now becaus at olx we get esteem around 1 lakh with CNGkit installed in it petrol mileagebis average but cng mileage is 23 to 27 which is very nice. In terms of performance it is the vehicle of highway because it is not good because of its accelaration but because of its top speed which is around 185 in speedometer but real speed is around is 165 to 170 which is still good overall the car is comfortable and worth the value ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
MarutiSuzuki;Esteem;25 Jul 2020;Rahul Nakhwa;4.7; Family Car ;Esteem is the best. Comfort car for long distance driving. Adhesion with road of the car is excellent. maintenance is very low. Tough car for off-road too.ground clearance is little bit low. Big trunk in rear is more then enough. I love this car very much.so don't want to sale it.
