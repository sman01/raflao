BMW;3Series20152019;8 Jul 2019;Prodeep Ghosh;4.7; Daily Commute ;I live to drive and for me it provides the ultimate driving experience. It is a personal indulgence and whether for short commutes (well not exactly in NCR where my office is 30 kms away) and long drives, it's a pleasure to drive the car. What has amazed me is its consistent city mileage in excess of 12 kms/liter and highway mileages exceeding 18. Maintenance is expensive. A snipped wing mirror se t me back by 35k; routine service as prompted by the car is hardly less than 15 to 20k. Fortunately there is a growing tribe of luxury car third party service centres that do an equally good job at one third the official ones, at least there are quite a few in Delhi/NCR. Overall, if you have one driving indulgence and stretch your finances - go for the BMW.

Air sensing climate control on individual seats and auto control of fog etc .is most relevant feature ...
