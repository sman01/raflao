ISUZU;DMAXVCross20152019;5 Feb 2019;P Ashish;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Give a very strong road presence and stance. Fun to drive. Customization list is long and one should not go in for all mods together rather take your time, investigate,learn, talk and then decide. (One can nor resist building ones mod list ranging from upside tyre, engine remap, bumpers, tonneau cover, lights, bar lights, sports roll bars, interior seats, floor mats, music system, free flow filter s, exhaust, lift, suspension upgrade, canopy, the list just keeps building It is a big truck...so one needs to modify the driving style and parking is a problem...One need not be able to park where one wants to go..so searching parking near where you want to go and then walk is a norm. Can take 5large bodied passengers with ease., highway drive is fantastic not wobbles or lateral sways at any speeds. Can speed up but it is always good to be in control of speed..Indian highways are not for very high speefs ( above 120 as too many people think driving in wrong sides, crossing toads as if in a park, driving slow anywhere in anything is a birth right or a democracy in India provides this a in the constitution - ðŸ˜‰pun intended) Overall..once you ride this...you can not go down to a saloon or a Bach back or a smaller vehicle.Remember this may be your last diesel as the next purchase may not even have a diesel option in the market...
ISUZU;DMAXVCross20152019;10 Oct 2018;Pema Rabgye;2.7; Daily Commute;I bought this car very recently, it's been 10 days now, but I haven't got any documents like invoice and dealers certificate so far, thus preventing me from registering the vehicle, I'm planning a long trip within a week but I guess I've to cancel it coz without registering the vehicle I can't travel. And the General Manager of Kolkata is very very rude.
