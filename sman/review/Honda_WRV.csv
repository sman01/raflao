Honda;WRV;8 Nov 2020;Pankaj Gupta;1.0; Daily Commute ;We bought wrv honda car in dec’2017 from prime honda showroom, Patparganj, New delhi, India and within the warranty period our music system display stopped working.Warranty they provide is for 3 years.Rude behavior of staff.No professionism.There’s no time guarantee/limit when it comes to after sales service in warranty period.The service within the warranty period is horrible and pathetic or is there’s any worst word than that? within the warranty period our music system touch screen stopped working.It has been more than 2 months since we registered our complain against the music system to get replaced.We got the complain registered on 20th august, 2020.Since then we have been going to the showroom again and again and we have been asking them on call that when is it going to get change.Person who sits on front desk i.E.Ms.Lata, She spoke really rudely to us and also her manager mr.Sudhir.Our phone calls aren’t answered and if in any case they answer our call, They disconnect our call.Is this what you called the professionalism or after sales service??? we have recorded all calls and can provide to anyone.We have been asking the time period that when are we going to receive the new music system because it have been 2 months now and interiors of the car without a music system is useless.They themselves don’t know when it is going to arrive.So that means if it doesn’t come in 6 months or even a year then we are going to stay without a music system for next 6 months and even a year because it isn’t coming from the company.Excuse me?? are we fools here who are going to get fooled by you?? that is the after sales service you provide? or call it in warranty.Sorry but the warranty service offered by honda is really bad.So if people reading my review still wants to buy wrv or any other honda car because all cars have music touch system now and wants to waste money then go ahead and dare it to waste it because our complains are heard by no one in honda.We have freaking paid you for all this.You arent doing it for free.If we had to pay money for it then for sure next day only the music system would have arrived.It’s shocking to see such a well-known company with such disgusting after sales services and the behavior of the staff of prime honda showroom in patparganj.Feels like all positive reviews are fake on google and on the other websites.If any higher authority is reading this review then kindly contact p******2@gamil.Com because we are sick and tired of calling and going to the showroom again and again.And our complain isn’t getting heard.Wish we never bought this car.
Honda;WRV;16 Jul 2020;Manan Shah;5.0; Daily Commute ;Just purchased WRV VX petrol version despite of many comments of underpower. Honestly I am extremely happy with the engine and overall performance. Superbly designed and enough specious in this range. Worth to have this car
Honda;WRV;31 Aug 2020;Prateek Joshi;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;In City it's really good... For long drive it gives 17 to 20 mileage which is very good for Honda. Most of the features in 11 L is make this car attractive. Only concern is 1.2 L of petrol..1.5 L would be better choice.
