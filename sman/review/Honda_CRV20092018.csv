Very Bad support and services to even understand a Customer Iss .. They will not call you and speak will not hear you out but only state how long they are working in the Company . Which is like Hell to what the Customer is facing .. I took this car last year .. it broke down with in Year .. At the same cost You have much better product in Indian Market ...Don"t buy this car ... does not meet any requirements on Indian Road .. and worst is the Services ... they believe in their King size Egos.. without meeting the Cust requirements .. Please don"t Buy this car .
