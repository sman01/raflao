Hyundai;Aura;18 Jul 2020;Shankar Venk..;4.7; Daily Commute ;Awesome Sporty looking Mini Sedan. Decent cabin space for 4 passengers. Smooth to drive. Very good mileage even in city conditions. Enough boot space. Pickup good enough for a smooth city drive, don't expect that extra turbo pickup which maybe their turbo model has. Front looks very appealing. Rear could have been better. The black C panel adds beauty to its rear thus masking the rear flaws. Overa ll very satisfied with the car
Hyundai;Aura;15 Mar 2020;DaRK RiDeR;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Best looking car, more features in less price like wireless charging, mileage approx:- 21-22kmpl, Boot space is good, trunk of that car is very impressive because of big space, new colour options, stylish alloy and sports like interior, but you will not get wireless charging in last all 4th models but in top model and second model will get wireless charging.
Hyundai;Aura;14 Aug 2020;Mitesh Vasava;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;good mileage, comfort and. premium interior good car in handling good thing is this car comes in 3 engine option 1 lit turbo for fun to drive, 1.2 diesel for more torque and mileage, 1.2 petrol for smoother driving and 1.2 petrol CNG is for daily routine people i love this car by premium look and interior in this subcompact sedan segment.
Hyundai;Aura;1 Sep 2020;Pulak Das;4.3; Family Car ;Excellent in driving, very nice breaking, pickup also not bad, comfortable riding, Space is very good. KPL is not that good when the car is fully loaded. If load is in lesser side it gives 22KPL in highwayNot happy with the headlights, it should have been more effective.
