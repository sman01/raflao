MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;23 Sep 2018;Anand Gupta;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Very comfortable car for driving due to Automatic transmission. I have Baleno Alpha -AT. Average in city getting 13 kmpl. For Pune/Shirdi highway 16.0 kmpl, for Gujarat highway 18.0 kmpl (FROM MUMBAI).Specious back seat and enough leg room for front seat. Spacious for 2 family luggage room.No issue while pick-up on hills with L-Mode. Easy for overtaking with S - Mode.Auto-android working fine with good navigation system for road guidance.Issues while driving - 1. Can not hear any incoming call ring in car while driving and missed the call often.2. Can not see video while driving . (+ point ONLY).
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;1 Oct 2018;Rakesh Kumar;5.0; Family Car ;Baleno-Petrol- Delta -Overall performance is very good ,milage is outstanding,while am driving milage of 20.8avg in highways for a litre of petrol. Safety is excellant ,abs saved me three times when I suppose to hit back side of bus for sudden braking without indication while going in highway at a speed of 120 .I recommend to buy this one and suggest to not goin speed as in turnings it may topple due to less weight.Interiors superb and music system outstanding .Enjoying driving and I feel good.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;19 Apr 2020;RKS S;4.0; Family Car ;BALENO ZETA MODEL IS NORMAL AND GOOD LOOKING CAR. SMOOTH DRIVING WITH GOOD MILEAGE..MAINTENANCE COST IS VERY LOW.. HANDLING IS AWESOME..ONLY ONE THING IS NOT GOOD..THAT IS ITS BODY PARTS ARE NOT SO STRONG..BUT OVERALL ITS VERY NICE CAR.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;28 Jan 2019;Lalit Bhati;4.3; Daily Commute ;I have driven my baleno almost 40000km till now. It has been a good car till date but there is some issues with its build quality, build quality is not up to the mark. I always get overall milage up to 22-23km/l. On highway you can get better milage up to 30km/l but depends on your driving habits.. overall I am happy with Baleno. I want to request Maruti kindly improve it's build quality.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;5 Dec 2018;Yatin Prabha..;1.3; Family Car;This car is not safe for long drive. All parts are made of plastic and body is not tough. Due to that reason when you drive a car on highways if other car passes through you. Your car vobbles. Secondly average is 12 km on highway and 9 km in city petrol version.. which is really disgusting to me., overall I am not at all satisfy with this car.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno20142018;9 Jan 2019;Prabhashanka..;4.0; Family Car ;A good car worth its value. Mine is zeta 1.2 petrol version. Mileage has not gone below 16 km.in city driving. In highways it depends on your driving style. Optimum mileage of 23 km.obtained in the highways when driven properly. Overall very good car. Very stable. Light could have been more powerful. Seats start creaking after six months.
