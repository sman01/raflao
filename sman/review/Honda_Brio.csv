Honda;Brio;25 Jul 2020;Siddh Shah;4.3; Occasional Commute ;1.2 L pure Japanese Engine literally brings life to the car and especially low weight which gives high torque and high speed. Because of low ground clearance, it is aerodynamically stable at very high speeds. Because of low center of gravity and very low turning radius, it is very easy to turn the car at sharp turns and at high speed without worrying that the car would topple or rollover. It has s moothest steering, smooth clutch pedals and gearbox too. Despite of being a small car, it has excellent leg space (greater than Baleno).
Honda;Brio;3 Dec 2018;Jigar Rana;5.0; Family Car ;I have Purchased the Honda Brio Automatic at 17/02/2018. First if you are the owner of Honda brio then you must change the driving Style of your Driving. You must drive your car below 2000 RPM on Highway & car Speed must be between 70 to 90 with Light Foot and Eco Light must blink there then you will definitely will achieve the mileage of 22 to 25 KM/litre.first i was also not able to get the mile age on highway then gradually change the style of driving today i am happy owner of Honda Brio.infact in city i am getting the mileage of 15km/litre but eco light must be there. riding is excellent, style is excellent.... first 6 month i was soo much confuse how to get best mileage from this car as have invested almost 7.30 Lakhs behind this car.. but not i am happy.
Honda;Brio;4 Oct 2020;Mohit Singh;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;The car is super peppy and a good car for a person who travels place to place alone or just with a partner the car is spacious ive clocked nearly 1 lakh km with no major issues in the car ,just the gripe is lower variants lack airbags but being a 2013 model can't complain much the car will run years and years if you just change the oil right
Honda;Brio;5 Oct 2020;Yatindra Vyas;5.0; Family Car ;Honda brio is a small budget luxury car. It is good for low budget families. Honda is provided best silent petrol engine with 18 to 21 kmpl mileage (depend upon driving conditions). Its is smooth, silent, comfortable and luxury interior car.
Honda;Brio;21 Oct 2020;Fahad Aijaz;3.0; Daily Commute ;A nice car if you are driving only within the city and regular roads.It's a pain drive on off-road as the ground clearance is pretty low.The engine is of course very refined and the space inside the cabin is pretty good.
Honda;Brio;11 Jan 2019;Shawn Dsouza;4.0; Tours ;Great small car to own. The rev happy 1.2 I-vtec is the Star in this car. For a car of it's size, it provides good comfort and ample space for 4 average sized Indians. Honda's quality is amazing. The tiny hatchback is surprisingly good at high speeds and just sticks to the road. Biggest downfall of the Brio is it's service cost. Some components seem ridiculously overpriced.
Honda;Brio;15 Aug 2019;Sukhesh Gopalan;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours ;I purchased the car (AMT) version with no much of a expectation as I prefer an automatic transmission. I would say, the car has indeed exceeded my expectations. Drives are quite smooth not only in the city but also on highways. Would recommend this car if you are planning for a budget friendly reliable strong AMT.
Honda;Brio;22 Nov 2018;Rajkumar Patil;3.7; Family Car ;the best turning radius of the steering / wheels make it smooth run in a traffic or even in a crowdy market. Also fits in small parking areas. Car looks very small from outside but Honda"s inelegance has made it surprisingly spacious inside! Best car for the cities. only need to be ridden on preferably smooth roads.

Honda;Brio;26 Jul 2018;Nishant Khan..;4.0; Daily Commute ;Oh it's such fun to drive and effortless. I have in fact taken it to the hills. It's just a no-nonsense car. The suspension & speed for a small car of its size is awesome. Rev it up and it will respond. Especially the steering is super light and the service cost is "zilch".
