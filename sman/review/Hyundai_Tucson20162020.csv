Hyundai;Tucson20162020;23 May 2019;;4.7; Tours | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;As i belong to a northeast state mizoram,where the roads are in very very bad condition,so i needed something strong in the engine and a good ground clearance, and the most important of all showroom and servicing centre, i really wanted to have a jeep compass but we dont have a showroom nearby, the nearest is guwahati which is more than 400 kms with the worst damaged roads from my place to the ser vicing centre,but i wanted an SUV which has a servicing center near by me, so in SUV our state has Hyundai, Ford, Nissan,Renault n Mahindra,so i decided to do a survey and found that Tucson is the best choice for me, there is ford endeavour but the price and the height due to which its very difficult to see whats infront of me, Duster, mahindra are very common in our state, so i thought whh dont i try Hyundai Tucson by Hyundai, but the Hyundai showroom did not have a Tucson for trial, as the price was a ove 20 lakhs so they told me that they will have to book, as even guwahati didnt have stock, so Hyundai placed an order from the Hyundai plantwhich took 5 months to reach my place, and when it reached ,Hyundai released a statement that i was the first one in north east (7 states) to have a Tucson, and it made a good impact on my social network.Now let me come to the experience, its really a perfect SUV ,ground clearance is good and the engine, its a blast good pick up, the modes are very useful and the looks i dont think anyother SUV can be compared to the awesome looks of Tucson, its like everything is perfect.Interior is one of the best designs in this segment with one of the best music system and semi woofers , so smooth that you cant even know the engine is on or off and can climb or cross rivers and run on the worst roadswithout any problem.its the best SUV in its segment
