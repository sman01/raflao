MarutiSuzuki;Estilo;15 Sep 2019;Aaditya Khare;2.7; Occasional Commute ;never choose any car with less wheel base it was our first car and not at all suggested to anyone to go for such a car with less wheel base, small tyre size.many times we faced problems because of it. Often it got punctured or engine oil seal got damaged during the travel as objects got struck/hitting the car because of which sometimes we faced sever problem during over journey. Once engine got se ized and car stopped in the road itself as it was not able to cross a bump on the road and oil leakage was there because of which engine got seized.also maruti service was not appropriate.Overall exp. was bad with the car.
MarutiSuzuki;Estilo;30 Sep 2020;Riyazulislam..;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I own a Zen estilo as a secondary car, it has now been driven more than 1,10,000 kilometers and still drives perfectly. It is a nice car for both city, and short trips to my hometown. The car has a little much ground clearance as compared with other hatchbacks, so i donâ€™t have any issues in using on the roads of my rural town. The car is great for rough use as we Indians do and i didn't need to spend much on it too. The 1000cc petrol engine is enough for daily city use and gives a mileage upto 15kmpl.
MarutiSuzuki;Estilo;9 Oct 2019;Gopendra M;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;its an average car for middle class. no problems if maintained well. it lacked many features at that time when i bought in 2008. maruti is good brand and timely serviced cars will remain good. i would suggest to get it serviced little earlier than recommended. (in place of one year, get it serviced in 9-10 months)
