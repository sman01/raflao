Hyundai;i20Active;23 May 2019;Lohith N;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours;I own 2015 diesel i20 active drove 122000 as on date, if you need an hatchback with super good suspension, ground clearance and smooth engine just go for it ! Pros1)Suspension and ground clearance is super good, it has got 190mm ground clearance you can easily glide over bad and patchy roads even on tall big speed breakers with ease. 2)Comfort, it is freeking awesome 3)Good seats for long journey trust me I"m a daily highway commuter 70% of km of my car is on highway 4)Mileage on highway 18-19kmpl, city 16-17 kmpl5)Ac cools fast, it also got air vents at the back6)Good instrument cluster7)Powerful and super smooth engine 8)Lite clutch9)Wide tyres with R16 alloys Cons1)Lifeless steering, it is so lite that you can even move with your pinky finger2)Spongy brakes the abs kicks in lately3)Wipers aren"t big enough for such a big windscreen4)bumper and other fiber parts used for exterior body are not of a good quality
Hyundai;i20Active;26 Feb 2020;Jawhar Balas..;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;If you are looking for a car that is safe, performs like a pro, comfortable, with modern styling and all segment breaking creature comforts - Pls go ahead and buy i20 Active. Been driving it for the past 4 years - one heck of a Car when it comes to the highways, fun to driver and safe too. But if mileage is your number one priority, you might have to look elsewhere
Hyundai;i20Active;20 Feb 2020;Kashish Dahiya;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours ;My car never let me down, be it torque, top speed, higher ground clearance, rear ac vent, tilt-telescope steering adjustment, cooled glove box, automatic climate control, auto headlights, smart key less entry, gps, diamond cut alloys, steering turning head lights, commutative reverse camera. All in all I would say best premium hatch back in India under 10 lakhs.
Hyundai;i20Active;30 Jul 2019;Anil Das;4.0; Family Car ;I owned i20 active SX (P) last year, 2018 face lift and driven 15000 km. Pros are the superb riding quality, comfort, cooling, music with 4+4 speakers, light steering, strong built body and easy shifting of gears. Cons are the fuel consumption which is about 8-9 kmpl in the city and 14-15 kmpl on highways while in AC on condition. The visual quality of cladding on external parts is poor as it look s faded black color but is strong. Important features lack on the top model too as break assist, distance to empty, traction control, average/ instantaneous fuel consumption etc. However the featured car i am satisfied with.
