Tata;Vista;8 Feb 2020;APACHE RTR;4.0; Family Car ;It's a wonderful Car offering the best of features along with the safety among contemporary cars. But it disappoints on mileage front, as it delivers around 11 in the city and overall highway mileage is 14 on AC, if driven 80+, 16 if driven below 70. I feel it's turbocharger is the main cause for low mileage, it should have been properly tuned, but at the same time, you never feel short of power u pto 100.
Tata;Vista;25 Feb 2019;Vidya;4.0; Daily Commute ;I love my Indica Vista.. but I guess owing to the ageing of the vehicle the car has been giving a lot of repair works which is quite natural. However, the mileage during good and merrier days was not more than 11kmph on regular commuting roads within city and just about 14-16kmph on long drives at an accelerated speed pointing between 70-85. But overall it"s a lovely sturdy steady vehicle with amp le space inside and very comfortable to drive and maneuver with ease on the roads ... simply loved every bit of my journey with this handsome honcho, Indica Vista ofcourse ... ;-p ...
Tata;Vista;4 Nov 2020;Percy Jassawala;5.0; Family Car;The Vista D90 has superb acceleration and the Vista's cavernous interior design allows the whole family (and sometimes more) experience the mighty diesels pull. We have been experiencing 2020 hot hatch performances as early as 2013, thanks to this Tata Fiat combo at 2/3rd of today's prices.

Tata;Vista;11 Apr 2019;Ajay Goswami;4.7; Daily Commute ;This is our driver driven car for my doctor wife. The performance of the car is proven to be excellent since 17years of use 90000km running. Highly stable and comfortable in high speed, though power/pick up is bit less at low speed. Any way overall we are satisfied with Tata Vista (Diesel).
