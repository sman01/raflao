Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;9 Nov 2019;Deepranjan G..;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Our first preference was to buy Ford figo but the varriant we wanted ford couldn't deliver so we choosed Elite i20 petrol and after 2 years I think it was best decision. We had a little less budget so we purchased the era varriant that is very rare and difficult to get. We bought it in 2017 november. I am driving the car for 2 years. Done about 9000 kilometers. The only one thing to sacrifice abou t it is the milage. I am a light footed driver. Always shift to 5 th gear in 60kmph and very ocassionally go over 100kmph. I get milage about 9-10 in town with ac and 13-15 in highway. But for its very good built quality and comfort I never mind for it. And one more thing I am talking about 2017 model. One of my friend bought 2018 model he is getting 11 in town and 16-17 in highway. For the people who prefers cars which give peace of mind while driving prefers a car which is very easy and efortless to drive i20 is one of the best 5 seaters under 10 lakhs for them. Talking about maintanance, Out of 3 service 2 service is the major oil change service which I had to pay the for consumables and for wheel balancing and allignment. In 1st year oil change service I paid 1950 including engine oil oil filter and wheel balancing. In 2nd year service I paid about 2850 including Engine oil, Oil filter, Air filter, Wheel Balancing and Wheel allignment. According to my idea its very reasonable. For my experience in 2 years If someone looking for a family car for driving 3-4 days in a week and 500-600 km in a month and go for long rides ocassionally then i20 is best hatchback for them. Backseat space is also great so 5 adults can seat in the car for long rides.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;31 Jul 2020;Dheeraj Pareek;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The Car is literally good for those who are going to buy there first car as its a hassle free car, for new people they don't have knowledge that what happens when you buy a car and find noisy cabins and less styling feature & safety features inside a car. although i will say Hyundai never claimed good averages in any of there Petrol car but if you want a Mileage machine i will say its better to sk ip Petrol and get the Diesel or go for Maruti Suzuki as they are famous for making mileage machine cars.i almost get a 18-22kmpl in highways or on long routes if you drive like 70-80kmph then you can get easily 17-18kmpl. In City well i live in a small city so on average if i drive 5-15km then i would get 10-12kmpl at maximum. if you extend it to like 30kmpl there is a chance you can get 15kmpl at maximum depends how gentle you drive your car.if you drive like 50-70kmph then definitely you will get more then 19 and even can go upto 22kmpl but trust me that would take your time, and if time is not your priority in that case you can really achieve good mileage.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;2 Dec 2020;Shreyansh Ja..;4.3; Daily Commute ;Elite i20 is a decent package by hyundai.It provides better styling, Features and road presence than its other rivals.But if you are a car enthusiast who loves acceleration, Then this car is not for you.You can try its turbo petrol but still not up to its mark.Its build quality is fabulous.No crinkle sound from the panels even after many years.Touch and feel of interior is definitely up to its mar k, Gives you a feeling of luxury.Handling is decent.But at high speeds like 100 or above.It definitely don't give you the confidence.Seats are comfortable.But you sit a bit lower comparing to its rivals.Breaking is also good.Better safety options.You'll feel it's 1.2l kappa petrol engine underpowered sometimes.You need to downshift the gears for overtaking.So, If you are a smooth driver and for whom powerful performance is not primary, Then this car is for you.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;24 Nov 2020;Abhijit Ray;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I am a bit disappointed while comparing this version of i20 with my previously owned 2009 model i20. Its seems that the internal space has somehow been compromised, ride quality has gone down. However places where this car puts a smile on my face is - 1. Styling - it definitely is a gorgeous piece of art. 2. The keen eye to features which really matters - speed sensing door locks, automatic head l amps, rear camera with guidelines, door ajar warning.. just to name a few. 3. Right Sizing - the vehicle is nor too crammed up neither too spacious (compared to its older sibling) and thus fits into quite a number of tough parking spots in the city. 4. The aftersales service - not sure if hyundai solves all your problem or not but does sincerely listens. You can count on one fact, they will value your time.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;27 Jun 2020;Rahul Singh;3.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have been driving this car from 5 years really had a very good experience with this car evn I have taken this car to the mountains tosh Manali loved it to ride evn there. Very comfortable on long drives too It gives you a smooth ride where ever you take this car The draw back is the rear sitting space for long drives I could recommend only 2 persons at the rear if you want to enjoy your journey second thing that sucks is the mileage with the petrol version it delivers only 12 km in the city and 14 -15 on the high way About safety I had 2 Major accident with this car but still we were safe Notting happened due too it's build quality thank God I was not driving a maruti car . In terms off saftey this car will never let you happen any thing
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;26 Nov 2019;David S;3.3; Daily Commute ;Very nice. Sale Executive respond and explain everything about the Do & Don't of the vehicle and what is the function and how to operate with all the Features provided.I am worried only with the poor mileage. 10 to 12 KMPL in the city, 15 to 16 KMPL in the highway. Since i'm from Shillong the Hilly areas, found that the performance is very weak. Little bit up or hilly vehicle wont go in a 2nd Gear . About Features i really appreciated, its really well and good. Vehicle is very stable no vibration even at the speed of about 120KMPH or 150KMPH. Only the SEAT is not comfortable as it is created as a Box type, for a long journey its really create a back pain and uncomfortable.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;27 Sep 2019;Rohit B;5.0; Daily Commute ;I own the Hyundai I20 since 2016.Hyundai i20 is an amazing car, the driving experience is excellent, good acceleration and worth buying this car. The car has great safety features, music system, excellent sound quality. A.C, of the car gives proper cooling. The car is much spacious with ample legroom. It has great boot space.Hyundai i20 is my favorite car ever I bought it before 2.5 year. Still, I didn"t find any problems in my car that is how good it is. Hyundai has done a great job in making this car. I have completed 36000 kilometers but still, it is very good in the condition so it is good to go for the i20.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;30 Sep 2020;S Sivarao;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Very Good car to travel within city or on highways. Front seats are quite comfortable. Thigh Support in back seats could be better. Overall Good for 4 people. Drive quality is superb. Feels so safe to drive at very high speeds also. Mileage in city traffic is average. On highway, when you go around 70-100kmph car will give you mileage of around 17kmpl. Above 100kmph even 15kmpl is doubtful. In cit y conditions, 12-14 depending on traffic and clutch usage. Struggles to pickup once speed goes down to zero but once it gets going drives amazingly fast. Boot space is small. Overall love my car.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;14 Jan 2020;Subhamoy Cha..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Beautiful, powerful, comfortable, equipped, wide, spacious, lively car. Only that inspite best of my efforts, I have never been able to cross the 12kmpl barrier. I calculate: total KMS ÷ fuel used (full tank auto cut off to full tank auto cut off). The refuelling gives the total fuel used and use against the KMS cat had run. on highways, I have got a Max of 15 kmpl, driving very technically corre ct with the company recommendation and maintaining all technical limitations. and facing some it's and bits problems, calling for a molestation of my wallet. But still, overall a very good car.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;10 Oct 2020;Samiran Hand..;3.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I wish I had bought Venue instead which was just launched. I didnt knw how the pertrol engine is in I20. Best hatchback till 2019. 2020 onwards the car are much better equipped and stylish. Plus the performance of I20 from my personal experience is not that great. It asks to drive calmly, sudden overtakes will need gear downshifts otherwise you can drive easily on lower power/torque during lower r evs on higher gears eg 1.5rpm at 4th gear or 5th gear at a slow speed city bumper to bumper movement. The is definitely smooth and comfortable on bad roads and long drives.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;19 Aug 2018;Vinay Gupta;4.0; Daily Commute ;it's a good car. Very good comfort level, good build quality materials used inside & outside of car but need to compromise with mileage of petrol i20. But one thing sure once you enter inside of car & drive it, you feel premium car like Audi driving experience. Performance wise car takes times to get pick up in 2nd gear, It easily go 60 - 100 km without any extra efforts very smoothly after 1500 - 200 RPM. Need to say if you are looking for premium class with good comfort can go blindly with i20 but mileage wise slightly slow compare to any Maruti vehicles... What else to say further.... As i have Elite i 20 Asta O Petrol 2017 model and driving busy Bangalore city traffic gets around 11 -12 km in city & highway around 14 - 16 km depends driving pattern. You can easily get around 16 km with smooth driving on highway & 12 km in city with full time Ac. Even i gets same till now. Maintenance come around 5- 7 thousands with service interval 10000 km.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;25 Sep 2019;Raju Dave;1.7; Daily Commute ;it"s a worse car, very poor pickup due to rubber band effect.diffcult to overtake other vehicles on highway. I sold out my new car with in 2 months due to above problem. Mileage is also very poor in city traffic 9-10 kms only. it"s my heartily request to all of you don"t by cvt, AMT cars go for DSG transmission like Volkswagen Polo GTI or Vento Tsi. If you have any doubt call me on 902****441.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;7 Feb 2020;Suman Kanthula;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Only prob I have is, if the door glass is opened and engine is turned off, only way to close the glass is to turn on the engine... I have seen in Skoda these can be operated using key.. This is one of the best feature and usability. Even after central locking you can close all your windows with is key control.
Hyundai;Elitei2020172020;10 Sep 2020;Utsav Ravat;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Very Good Car.
