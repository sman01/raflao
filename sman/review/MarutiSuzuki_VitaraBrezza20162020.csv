MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;13 Jan 2020;Zozo Zoe;4.3; Tours ;I really had a superb experience with my vitara. Although offroading was a tough on it went pass through it while tearing off my lower body guards. Everything is excellent with the brezza but a little weak in performance on hills other then that it really cruises around on perfect soiled roads. One thing I would like to see on future upgrades is the ground clearance with 200 mm, with bigger alloy size like 17 inch, rear boot space should be expand by increasing length width breadth of the car while adding more bold looks like the old grand vitara with sunroof led tail lamps offering LCD touch and keyless on 2nd top models and not only do plus options. The rest its perfect
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;22 Feb 2020;Mangesh Pada..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Good car to drive in city as well as on highway, I have zdi model, it misses out on one featus automatically folding mirrors witch I think would be handy in heavy city traffic but it has good visibility please and also has a big mirrors to have good view behind. car is also good to drive on long route and it's very comfortable, but if your are a kin drive you will come to know that it's under powe r in ghats section, and also feel a bit nurvousness at higher speeds more then 120km because the staring becomes lighter and shakes a bit on a minar road patches. but it has a good bild quality and also has a good mileage of 24kmpl if driven properlyüòÅ.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;17 Dec 2020;Gourab Kundu;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Best car in terms of price.If some one maintain the car it will give the best performance.Overall handling is very good.Comfort is descent.Mileage is the best part, Maximum mileage we achived 28kmpl.Overall good car.I changed all the four tyres at 1lack + kms.The stock tyres lasted 1lack + kms.As per the service centre we have to change the timing belt at 1lack + kms.One suggestion for every brezz a owners: refuel the car before the warning light turns on because if you run the car at low fuel it will damage your high pressure pump which costs around 40, 000.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;4 Sep 2019;Alex Thomas;3.3; Family Car ;Faulty transmission from the very first day. Reverse and first gear noisy and gear slips in inclined road. Transmission system light goes on. Done only 9500 kms. The dealer admitted that it is a manufacturing defect. Thanks to the service manager of Popular Vehicles, Kottayam. Now in garage for complete clutch replacement. Don't know whether it will resolve the problem. Disappointed about AMT syst em. Otherwise comfortable on road. Long journey gives 23 kms/lit with AC and in town 13kms/lit. Generally poor customer care services.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;7 Feb 2020;Somtirtha Ba..;3.7; Daily Commute ;Convenient but the AGS/AMT is not robust . Sometimes it can‚Äôt figure out which gear to choose and overheats in bumper to bumper traffic 80% of the time . Worth considering only if it comes with a new engine and proper auto box (torque converter or cvt). My daily commute is 50kms from west to east Pune , ergonomics and features are good , mileage is decent but I‚Äôd be happier if the AmT didn‚Äôt keep overheating all the time prompting me to stop
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;14 May 2019;Shubham Kash..;1.7; Daily Commute ;Waste Of Money Engine is too much under powered even other brand small car have more powerful engines (totally under powered for such a big car)Poor build quality, Poor interior quality,Seats are too much hard and uncomfortable feels back pain in long drives.Suspension is too much stiff.Ride quality is pathetic even maruti 800 is better than this .rear passenger may get dead in long journeysüòÇ a ll road surface feels in it.Maintenance of 8 -10 k for normal service and 10-15 k for major service is high for such a 3d class car. Average in normal driving conditions hardly gives 15 16 kmpl.To much rattles wind noise engine noise inside cabin, poor feel inside. Totally flop only looks, technically flop.....Totally waste of product not worth of 5 lakh even entry level cars are much better than this
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;19 Jan 2021;Rk Rekha;4.3; Family Car ;The car is good, The mileage is good, Comfort is good, Th e mileage depends how you drive, The car will be good if it get a sunroof, More features should be added if you go for brezza buy the top variant the prices also got increased in 2021, But the thing is the 2020 variant and 2021 variant are same not asingle change.You can also go for sonet, Xl6.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;4 Nov 2019;Aditya On;4.3; Family Car | Tours ;Bought the Brezza Zdi+ variant. The car was a real fun to drive. The car was really cool with its looks and the mileage it delivered. Good for 4 people in cabin. The car really has a good riding position as the driver can easily have the view of the end to end view of the bonnet. That looks awesome. Do buy this if you prefer a fun high profile ride.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;5 Nov 2019;Sunjeet Bhadana;3.3; Daily Commute;Before 2nd service no issues. After my 2nd service, I observed that the pickup had gone completely. Next day again car sent with the complaint to service. Issue detected clutch worn out. They are replacing it for free. However, it is disappointing and I am apprehensive about the future of brezza AMT as a model. AMT seems to have a reliability issue
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;17 Sep 2020;Gamer Or;3.0; Family Car ;The company claims of 24+ mileage but it gave only 16-18 mileage on highways and 13-16 on common roads but i am happy with the car as it's external and internal looks and it's mechanical alloy wheels and a 1246 cc powerful engine with 5 speed manual transmission and overall I am happy with the car. Thanks to Maruti Suzuki!!
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;24 Nov 2019;Harshit Garg;5.0; Daily Commute ;I had a swift earlier then I wished to buy a compact SUV and I thought of this car. The overall performance and mileage of the car is just awesome,Being larger than swift it offers more mileage. Only thing that need to be improved is the quality of the dashboard. I m a happy Maruti customer.‚ò∫‚ò∫
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;29 Jun 2020;Prajodh Menon;4.3; Family Car | Tours ;Vitara Brezza is meant for long distance drives. Quite stable and can comfortably cruise to 120 continuously with a decent mileage. 26.4 kmpl, is the mileage which i have benchmarked in my Pune-Bengaluru-Palakkad trip for the last 2 years at a nice constant speed of 100kmph. Awesome!!
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;20 Feb 2019;Hrithik John;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;As the name says brezza is a beast on the highway it gets to triple digit speeds quite often very quickly. Driving in a ghat or curvy road is delight as the car has a lot of grip and stablity in in the city if you go through narrow streets then it gives you an alround proper visiblity and the ground clearance of mammoth 200mm is great as you don"t need bother about road beneath you. If you have a go anywhere attitude then this should be your pick and also the tax benefits too help in giving it an edge over its competition.

MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;19 Jun 2019;Joseph Amalraj;4.3; Occasional Commute ;Feels comfortable on bumpy roads. Good infotainment features including speaker quality. The Zdi+ variant covers many features and so there is no need for spending extra money on accesories. The doors are lightweight. I prefer heavy doors safe in case of impact from.side. Dashboard material is flimsy and very low quality. GPS is voice activated and cannot enter key words by typing. Pick up is not t o the expectation. Good for family inside city drive, less maintenance cost and good fuel efficiency.

MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza20162020;9 Oct 2020;Jagjot Singh;2.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;the car is ok to drive, the rattle noise of the plastic is just unbearable.
