MarutiSuzuki;SCross;7 Sep 2020;Muthamil Selvan;1.3; Daily Commute ;I own a scross diesel 1.2 litre which is a very average in premium segment (Maruti only selling in a premium segment) and also has very less mileage and performance... the built quality is very average... Not a specious vehicle when it’s compared with jazz, wrv, zest etc even though they are sub 4 meter cars... only value of having of Maruti cars is resale value is little high...
MarutiSuzuki;SCross;2 Dec 2020;Ayush Modi;5.0; Daily Commute;I doesn't not look like a maruti, the feel of the car is very premium and the mileage is of Maruti. I bought a zeta petrol and I easily get a mileage of 15 Kmpl in Delhi City Traffic. One of the best car from house of Maruti. In C segment best mileage car. Go for it
MarutiSuzuki;SCross;17 Aug 2020;Abhinav bhagat;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Amazing car from Maruti, very spacious having good leg room & big boot space. 1.5L petrol engine is very good gives a very good drive experience. Maintenance cost is not very high, mileage is good in city & on highway. Features of this car are good.
MarutiSuzuki;SCross;30 Sep 2020;Ramasamy Pon..;3.0; Family Car | Tours ;Mileage is really good only at low speeds even if you cross 110KMPH the mileage drops drastically. Performance wise its a OK car nothing exciting. Its brought for a overall performance car.
