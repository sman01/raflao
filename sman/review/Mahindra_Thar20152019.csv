Mahindra;Thar20152019;2 Oct 2020;Pemmaiah M;2.7; Family Car | Tours ;Mahindra Thar, the one what I have is the initially launched one in 2014, BS 3 complaint one. As we use it a Coorg its a beast made for the roads and off road capabilities there. Maintenance is nothing much. Proper riding, proper fuel,oil and air to be maintained and it will run well with no much issues. Haven't used 4/4 till now, but till now we never regretted that we bought this vehicle. Absolu te Gem on road to drive. Thanks Mahindra.
Mahindra;Thar20152019;19 Jan 2020;Ganesh Chandran;3.7; Tours ;No problem vehicle 9 years 178k In Odometer 3 sets of tyres, 8 wiper blades, 3 sets of brake shoes, 2 UNiversal joints, One soft top. One headlamp bulb.Had to change the brake system as the launch vehicle brakes were really worst. Rest all touchwood.
Mahindra;Thar20152019;29 May 2020;Prithvi Prasad;4.0; Occasional Commute;Strictly a second car, one cannot live with a Thar as a primary vehicle.Man's seeks pleasure in the weirdest of things, absolutely fallen for the looks , the stock off-road capability (modified even better) . Very useful if you own a farm/ranch.

The body work is rubbish. But the thar gives you more pleasure then your wife. After you drive this other cars feel like small toy cars.. I love my thar not mahindra.
Mahindra;Thar20152019;19 Sep 2018;Mahindra SYOUV;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;The THAR CRDe has captured the imagination of off-road enthusiast and city slicker alike. The New THAR CRDe has yet again set new benchmarks with its bold muscular road presence, unmatched go anywhere capability, refined and power-packed performance that‚Äôs best in its category.
