Hyundai;Verna20172020;24 Sep 2019;Rajesh Kumar;5.0; Daily Commute ;Very well maintained insideout Single owner single hand car with 80% highway miles means no city braking, cluth and suspension usage. This is a top end variant with Push start button, key less entry, all disk brakes and alloy wheels, 6 airbags, leather upholstery & POLK 4 speaker music system with FOCAL amplifier fitted. More than anything else the car drives very well without any issues with exce llent ride quality. Come check it out then take a call
Hyundai;Verna20172020;30 Nov 2019;Sankar Ram;2.3; Family Car ;Poorest of poor quality mechanics. Only outside beauty and styling is there. Overheating problems still exist, even after replacing major parts including engine assembly. Moreover nobody responsible from Hyundai will even attend to your call, not even the state head. Only the local area manager will talk to you , that too in a harsh tone, as though he is the owner of HMIL and is your godfather. Ki ndly do not buy Hyundai cars.
Hyundai;Verna20172020;7 Mar 2020;Raheem A;4.7; Occasional Commute ;I am having Verna Base model 1400 cc petrol . But it is good for long drive. Comfort & space are good . I am facing steering problem to some little extent. It lags to left side and causing some strain on right hand. When brought it to notice of service center they are saying nothing . Such problem is not felt in i20 & i10 which too I drive

And complained to attend abnormal irrational sound of doors and steering but the dealer returned the Wehicle without attending the problem and informed the same has attended and rectified. After so many reminders they are not turned with solution.
