Ford;Ecosport20152021;8 Mar 2020;Meherzaad Wykes;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The Family car of my house . dad gifted this car to my mom on 22/09/19 after her grand i10 drowned in floods in baroda and went in total loss and she generally uses it in the city and i use it occasionally to college (50kms both up and down) and this is the best compact SUV in india . Take anything its the best - highest water wading capacity (REQUIRED in baroda üòÇ) , looks , power , SAFETY , fe atures are not too tacky but all available are useful in daily times , mileage , ground clearance, We recently took our Fordy out in the diwali from baroda - ajmer - jaipur for 5 days and 2400 kms we just had to refuel (full tank ) it just twice for 3200 rs each. first full tank from baroda on the first day and the second one while leaving from Jaipur and we came back home in half tank pending . means 4800 was the fuel price for this trip gave us close to 22-23 KMPL. Totally worth it . i planned to buy a venue for me now this Feb'20 but why would i if i have uska baap at home ‚ù§ ?
Ford;Ecosport20152021;20 Jan 2020;Narasimha Pr..;4.7; Family Car;I bought titanium plus automatic model.I was very impressed with the safety features but was worried about the mileage part, as almost all reviews said , poor mileage.. around 8 km in city drive and about 10-11 km on highway.. since my usage was limited , took the risk and bought it. Now. I am pleasently surprised to note that the mileage I am getting is much higher. In city bumper to bumper traff ic with AC on, I am getting around 10 , and with moderate city traffic the mileage is around 11-12. However on highway I got 15 km with AC on.. which is very good considering it is an automatic transmission. I have driven about 2000 km and keeping the RPM around 2000-2500, as it is still engine run in phase. It depends on the driving pattern as well and I switch off the engine if the wait for green signal is more than 60 second, probably it helps.
Ford;Ecosport20152021;6 Jul 2020;Garima Gautam;3.0; Daily Commute ;I purchased Ford Ecosport on 14th Feb 2020. Soon after the purchase, noises has been coming from different sides of the car. The dashboard, the four side doors, and even from the back, it keeps making non continuous noises. These noises are causing me irritation and distraction while driving. I got car's first service at 3000km which was a little late due to nationwide lockdown. Even after the ser vice, noises/ sounds keep coming from either parts. The sounds sometimes stop coming own their own and sometimes don't stop at all. Its very troublesome and extremely annoying. I purchased Ford car because it has been reviewed as good quality/ heavy material built car but I am highly disappointed and unsatisfied with it. My experience with the Ford is a drastic let down.
Ford;Ecosport20152021;2 Oct 2020;Mani Sarwade;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;A brilliant car with best combination between the engine and the automatic gearbox...the gearbox works very..the gears shift is too fast and isnt lagy in any way -10/10 for gearbox and engine.There are enough features that can make u feel happy,comfortable. High speed stability is too good...u can take a sharp turn even in triple didgit speeds.Space in the rear is a bit of issueMileage that i got was 10-12 in the city and 14-15 on highway if you drive in linear wayIf u need any automatic SUV, just go for this one....its the both of performance and feature....its truely a performance orientated car...Reaally happy after purchasing this isntead of venue

Ford;Ecosport20152021;26 Dec 2020;Burges Dandi..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I drive the ecosport automatic titanium version.The only fault in this car is the mileage.Other than that, It‚Äôs absolutely amazing.I have been using it for 2.5 years now, Never had any problems with service or the car.The driving experience is extremely comfortable and honestly unmatched by any other sedan or suv in this segment.The ground clearance is perfect for mumbai roads as well as the kin d of terrain you need to go through in places like matheran or mahableshwar.I would highly recommend this car to anyone who can afford the mileage.
Ford;Ecosport20152021;4 Sep 2020;Arvind Yadav;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Ford ecosport is one of the best compact suv. I have driven the car for almost 4 years in city and on highway as well and didn't have any breakdown so far. Everything is working properly. What I miss is just rear camera touch screen infotainment system and led headlights which has been added to the new model and also the A pillar is too thick sometimes it gives problem in vision. Otherwise its an perfect car for driving with safty.
Ford;Ecosport20152021;29 Sep 2020;Drupath S;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Pros: Punchy diesel engine, steering has good feel and feedback and car has good handling hence called driver's car, good mileage for a 1.5 litre engine(21kmpl on highway and 19kmpl in city) service cost is reasonable (less than 5000 ).Great build quality.Cons: Not so spacious, especially rear seat.Stiff suspension, so back seat passengers won't feel so comfortable on bad roads. Service network is less compared to others.

Ford;Ecosport20152021;19 Mar 2020;Bobby Mani;4.0; Daily Commute ;DyThe vehicle is oK. But in lower. ROM THE power is very low. Another problem is design, they put vipper spray motor just behind the left fog light. Which is mounted on bumbe, the company deny warranty of the washer motor if there is any scratch on the bumber. On a vehicle of this size don't they find any place to mound the mirror anywhere other than this vulnerable spot.

Ford;Ecosport20152021;4 Dec 2019;Mohammed Fai..;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;This car is called as an SUV but its major problem is tiers losses its grip in mud roads during rainy season due to the torque, and front wheel drive.
