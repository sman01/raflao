Mahindra;TUV300Plus;1 May 2019;Prabhu Patel;4.0; Daily Commute ;Chose this instead of the popular Bolero. Was looking at a 9 seater with a little more finesse. On the upside it has the full Scorpio 2.2 MHawk engine. Very decent looks. The 9 seater actually looks far better than the 7 seaters imho. Suspension is hard and better for greater loads. This is a great vehicle for tour and travel operators. Overall Value for money. On the downside it lacks comfort and refinement - as say compared to a Creta. But then at that price it"s 👍.
