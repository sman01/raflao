MGMotor;ZSEV;20 Sep 2020;Sid Bhatt;5.0; Family Car | Daily Commute ;Once you drive an electric car you will never drive ICE car. MG ZS is a bit expensive but savings of electricity use will catch up. ProsLots of roomThough is compact SUV, it's stance is like an SUV with great visibility and easy to get in and outInterior is very comfortable Boot size is decent 0 - 100 it does in 8 secondsFinishing is goodiSmart AppConsSome features in App is missing compared to Th ai cersionMissing features Auto Pilot, blind spot assist, front sensorsMissing Led Jawad lamp plus missing Led bright light in cabin and boot.Very happy so far. Will write 6 months review soon.Range is no problem for me as I drive max avg 50 Kms a day so with 300 Kms range on full battery charging every 5th day. That's not bad also the feeling of not going to petrol pump is great. ( You know what I mean)Charging at home is simple. Car comes with home charge panel. Wiring is done by co and charging station 7.5 KW is installed free of cost. With higher cost of electricity in Mumbai it costs around Rs.1.2-1.5 per km. That's a lot of savings on my previous petrol car that used to cost close to Rs 8 per km.If you are planning to buy any ICE or EV will definitely insist to test drive MG ZS. You will never drive ICE car after this. With regen level 3, you can literally drive car using only 1 foot for acceleration for 95% of time.
