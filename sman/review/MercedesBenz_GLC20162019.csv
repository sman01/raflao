MercedesBenz;GLC20162019;8 Nov 2020;Rajan Manjrekar;4.7; Family Car | Tours ;I already owned honda brv.Wanted to buy on german.Mercedes only decided for few obvious reasons.So bought glc 220d formatic in march 2019.But still i was fearful to take it on long tours.So did only 6000 kms in last one year.And almost no commute in covid lockdown.But my decision to take it to goa tour changed my perception towards its real performance.I was very happy running 1500 kms to and for mumbai-goa.That too mainly from coastal road.Since then coming back to mumbai i am not driving my 3yrs old good honda brv.I'm so happy with mercedes glc 220d formatic.It has started giving me around 16-17 on kmpl on highways.Service cost for me not matter as i hv bought 4 years service pack.And its just one and half year since i bought it.Now i'm so much addicted to its power and automatic transmission that i'm thinking to sell my good honda brv (its really nice family 7 seater car) and to buy one 7 seater suv like ford endeavour or xuv500.As i think it's difficult now to run underpowered and manual car like honda brv.Thanks to german engineering.I'm 100% happy with my glc 220d formatic.
