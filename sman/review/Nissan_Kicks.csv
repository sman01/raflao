Nissan;Kicks;1 Aug 2019;Dilip Kumar;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;An excellent car.If you are a looking for a real SUV, then Kicks is the one. The 210mm ground clearance makes it the best fit for off-roading. The suspension is amazing. You wouldn't know about the gutters and pot holes on the road when you are in the Kicks. A sturdy body, wonderful steering, excellent ride quality and a quiet cabin makes it an ideal car for those long drives and City driving as w ell. The interiors are nicely done. The speakers could have been a little better but that's not a dampner. You have the option of customizing it which is something I did and this is an excellent option.Overall a wonderful car.
Nissan;Kicks;5 Aug 2020;Jatin Anand;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Performance is very much acceptable along with the excellent ride quality. Nissan is providing only 5 years of warranty(including 3 years of extended), warranty should be almost of 10 years, moreover I am missing 360 view camera in XV. They should have provided the 360 view camera also as a accessories.
Nissan;Kicks;29 Oct 2019;Sumit Gupta;4.3; Family Car;2000 kms drive done XLD . Giving mileage of 19.3. drive is very smooth even in diesel engine and suspension is too good. Looks wise bigger than creta and price wise cheaper than creta. Nice bootspace. Ride quality and space is awsome. Recommend test drive. I have changed mind after test drive only.

Nissan;Kicks;18 Mar 2020;Pranav Anand;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;I bought Nissan Kicks in October from Vertex Nissan, Sohna Road, and exchanged my Datsun RediGo for 2.2 lakhs inclusive of features. It's a sporty and comfortable SUV usable for daily commute and tours.
Nissan;Kicks;22 Jan 2019;Prabhasis Singh;2.7; Family Car ;Kicks is far from wat it is portrayed. Specially the petrol model is a disappointment. No leather touches on doors or dashboard No 360 deg camera which is so shown to be one of the key features No push button start available in the petrol modelsWhy on earth did they even have a petrol model. Petrol models need a serious face lift
Nissan;Kicks;20 Jul 2020;Ravi Lingudker;4.7; Family Car ;Ride quality, visibilty and comfort are quite discerning. Night shade stands out conspicuously, in particular. Regret, should have waited to own turbo 1.3 offering.
Nissan;Kicks;30 Jan 2019;Santosh Chil..;5.0; Family Car ;I tested kicks at 140 speed.. There is no vibrant and engine is smooth.. Break system is really awesome.. At 130 speed we checked the break quality.. It's very good not slippery car is stable.. Shock absorbers are very nice.. In pothole roads also there is no sound inside the cabin
