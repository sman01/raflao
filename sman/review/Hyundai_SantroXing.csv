Hyundai;SantroXing;14 Nov 2020;Bangalore Urdu;5.0; Family Car;Very beautiful car with very less driven. 2014 model, not even a single dot on the car, It's like showroom condition all services done in company. Only 50k driven you can check in showroom for confirmation. Not even a bolt and nut is open, company system with usb and aux. tyres are like new, very good in mileage give you around 20kmpl in city. All documents runningIt's AC and power staring3rd owne r Insurance running till September 2021#price 315000only very slightly negotiable
Hyundai;SantroXing;12 Mar 2020;Veerraju Tv;4.3; Family Car | Tours;Wonderful Tall body car, very spacious, comfortable riding with the excellent steering wheel. Very rarely I will get trouble with my Santro xing. To date I haven't faced any problem and the car is 20 KM's/ Litre after completing 135000 KM's also. Wonderful car. Very easy to service and maintenance cost is Rupees One thousand only after every 5000 KM's running.
Hyundai;SantroXing;23 Sep 2019;Vikalp Setya;4.3; Family Car ;I have owned Santro Xing GLS for over 10 years and a running of over 70,000 kms. The car is reliable, comfortable for 4 passengers and doesn"t need much maintenance. Servicing once every 10k km keeps it running like a charm. Build quality is also good. It does lack modern features like rear parking camera, sensors and safety features like ABS, safety bags
Hyundai;SantroXing;2 Apr 2020;K ABIRAM;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am owning Santro Xing GLS Since 2011. I feel very good experience with the vehicle. Here the Hyundai dealer very good when it is under Beau dealer but when it goes under the PEEYESYEM Hyundai dealer I am not satisfied with the vehicle services.!!
Hyundai;SantroXing;22 Feb 2020;Jay Rajput;3.7; Daily Commute ;Santro Xing is awesome car low maintenance.i drive 6 lac KM in 12 year no any problem in this time.one time replace front and rear suspension.and this time no any work to need my Santro.Super car, mileage claim 13KMPL City highway 15 to 15.5KMPL
Hyundai;SantroXing;8 Sep 2020;Nivesh Sakha..;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Its a very nice car. I purchased it at 2007 , i never faced any major maintenance issue. 1000 cc car never give my any power issue, it is most comfortable car, i went to Hyderabad from nagpur by this car, and It was a very comfortable Journey.
Hyundai;SantroXing;3 Jun 2020;Prakash K;3.3; Family Car;very good experience.... except I have to shell out a large amount of money twice every year for it's regular service.. The Hyudai Showroom where I give for servicing charges a lot...which I am fed up off... 😭😭😭😭😭
Hyundai;SantroXing;15 Oct 2018;Munavar Basha;3.7; Family Car ;WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER HATCHPACK CARS LIKE MARUTHI HYUNDAI ACCENT HYUNDAI VERNA ETC SANTRO ZING IS VERY COMFORATABLE TO TRAVEL WITH ITS TALL BOY DESIGN.AFTER CONTINUOUS TRAVELLING OF 300 KMS WE CAN GET OUT FROM CAR WITHOUT ANY HARM OF KNEES AND HIP. BUT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN HYNDAI ACCENT AND VERNA AND MARUTHI CARS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO STRAIGNT AND KNEES AND WAIT FOR SOME TIME TO GET OUT
Hyundai;SantroXing;28 Dec 2020;Automob Enth..;4.7; Occasional Commute ;Santro xing is a very unique car and with it's tall boy design it looks more appealing.It comes with 1.1 l engine which offers a great performance and build quality is also way better than the new santro.
