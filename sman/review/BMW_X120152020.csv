BMW;X120152020;20 Nov 2019;Georgin B;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;it is an amazing car with sporty character .throttle,steering,brakes everything is sharp so it will make us really confident behind the wheel but at the same time the suspension is little bit hard for maintaining body roll , and it works pretty well but it reducer the comfort especially in indian roads .it reduces engine noise and wind noise really well but it do have a lot of road noise but overa ll i think it is the best car in this price range
BMW;X120152020;21 Sep 2018;Dreamz Mynewcar;4.0; Family Car | Occasional Commute ;It is such a nice car. Its my personal review about the car and its moonroof is better than other comparative cars. I like this car very much and BMW is a good brand. The car is having big boot space, adjustable seats and automatic gear shift with very good performance.
BMW;X120152020;29 Aug 2018;Naveen Reddy;4.3; Daily Commute ;Excellent car. Good power. Good mileage on the highway rides.To be successful in getting bigger market share is have the service costs much lower.There should have been a reverse camera.
