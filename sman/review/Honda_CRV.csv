Honda;CRV;4 Sep 2020;Aditya Hura;4.7; Family Car | Daily Commute | Tours ;Mileage for an AWD car is extraordinary. Engine is very well refined and 9 speed AT(diesel only) is super smooth. Very comfortable and lots of space. Kinda overpriced tho.A very well balanced car and perfect for family road trips especially with the terrible road conditions of india right now.
