Volkswagen;Vento;4 Jan 2021;Sabyasachi R..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Highway mileage is always 22+ at a speed of 100-110 with 4 adult occupant and ac on.However, City mileage is around 12.5 with single occupant.Average is ~ 15-16 for diesel with 50-50 usage.Ac blower and cabin light switches are of poor quality and keep on breaking over time; and are expensive to replace these minor things.Steering mount switches are not functional after 5 years of usage.No other q uality issue.Getting rattling noise from front wheels and i can feel the instability on paddles as well, On rough roads.This is happening from last 2.5 years and service center guys are not able to identify the issue or fix it.Someone says frame welding is broken, Someone else says suspension needs replacement, Someone says the rubber padding on top of suspension are bad, But nothing is helping it out.The issue gets fixed only for 10-15 days after each servicing.Highspeed stability is good and even there is lots of power to overtake at high speed.Steering controls are good.Boot space is well managed to fit in a family luggage for a month - 4 big size trolleys and few more smaller bags.
Volkswagen;Vento;2 Oct 2020;Appunni Bala..;3.7; Family Car ;Its purely a driver's car, don't expect anything more from its. when you r behind the wheel you can feel that surge of power and that give you so confident to give throttle. Breaking system and vehicle stability is awesome. steering is equally weighed that can add on your confident at higher speed. And the best part is if you wish to overtake some vehicle you don't have to think twice just give th e command and it follows you.

Volkswagen;Vento;4 Aug 2020;Rajesh Gowdar;4.7; Daily Commute ;It is an good German engineered car. The performance is excellent and you don't get tired even after driving 350 Km at a strech. Match to perfection in engineering. It is an performance car and love to drive Its exterior and interior are outdated and do not match to the present styling.
Volkswagen;Vento;26 Jan 2020;Sarrtaj Gill;5.0; Daily Commute ;brilliant engineering. silent cabin, no sounds even after 5 years. dsg is a blessing. only issue is that i need to change the sensors during monsoon, if i wade through water logged roads.my best buy so far.
