Lexus;LS;18 Apr 2020;Udit Verma;4.3; Family Car | Daily Commute;Hard to beat ride as for as comfort, cabin noise, and reliability is concerned. One could be going 160 Kms/hr and inside car, one does not realize it unless look at speedometer. All the cars made by Toyota (Lexus being luxury brand of Toyota are legendary as for as reliability goes. Lexus does need to catch up with driver assist features and other electronic bell and whistles. I thing its wonderfu l family car for long drives. For daily commute, in some Indian Cities it might be difficult to maneuver and parking etc as it is relatively large car
