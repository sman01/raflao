Mahindra;Thar;3 Oct 2020;Md;3.7; Daily Commute ;Overhyped, and Overpriced. Pros:1. Design - An eye-catching boxy look, kind of mini wrangler2. 18inch allow wheels with better ground clearance. I am expecting to change the lane by driving over the road dividers in case the U-turn is more than 1km ;)3. As the city streets are no different than off-road streets these days with millions of potholes here and there, Thar serves the purpose of my dail y off-roading dreams ;)4. Good for a small family or use it as a second car5. Thar would definitely get you a girl if you don’t have one ;)Cons:1. Overpriced: Either M&M didn’t conduct price sensitivity testing among the potential buyers to identify the right pricing model, or they assumed that they are going to sell limited units, so why not at a premium cost? Those who wanna buy will buy anyhow.2. M&M isn’t aware of the new segment apart from those who buy Thar for off-road only - Regular office goers who want to use Thar as their daily car or a second car for a family outing during the weekends3. So many loose wires here such as the glass defrost at the back 4. There is no boot space officially. Even Tata Nano had better boot spaceConclusions:1. Eventually the buyers would curse Thar designers when they are over with the looks of Thar and start facing the real issues2. Bring down the cost of LX MT 4 seater to 12 lakh on-road. Don’t make the buyer considering better alternatives available after 15lk such as Nexon, Harrier, Hector, Seltos, and so forth.
Mahindra;Thar;5 Oct 2020;Angad Sharma;3.0; Daily Commute;M&M had lost it petrol version is too expensive in 2021 Suzuki will launch Jimmy possibly in 3 door and 5 door they should have utilised space on back properly in 4 seater as space near seats is useless no led lights in 2020 that's wierd diesel cannot say anything but petrol is punchy and usable sou d dampning in Bonet or any other parts that's wierd cost cutting glove box is of no use and I'm har dtop version they should have improved interior fittings
