MarutiSuzuki;XL6;29 Apr 2020;Ishaan Bahal;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;Bought it 3 months ago, have driven over 4k kms, though bought it as a car for office commute and family. First car of mine, wanted to buy something like baleno or Glanza or even altroz. But sat in this car at the showroom, and loved it, then tried venue, Nexon and a few others like wrv, but none provided the comfort this one did, especially on the second row. It's like a different class altogethe r. Did do a lot of research on the cars, even Ertiga. This car shares a lot of things with Ertiga, hell it's basically Ertiga with some enhancements added. But the look makes it more SUV types and not an MUV. Ended up buying this one, base variant, as suggested by the sales rep also, the misses from alpha are not too many and most can be fitted by maruti as extra accessories. I got them all in 10K including nexa lit badging on the doors, leather covers for seats, and rear parking camera. Driving experience has been great, it's a silent car and I love that over Chunky sounding SUVs, it drives like a car meant for city driving and also works quite nice on a highway. Hardly feel bumps etc. Did have an issue with the USB port for android auto from the get go, so got that sorted from maruti for free as a part replacement. More than the car, I actually like Nexa and it's post sale service. For sure the sales wasn't much to write home about, I had to ask someone explicitly to show me the car, but the post sales is actually good. They remind you of everything, even things like how to maintain your car if you forget. The service experience was also pretty great. It could just be my dealer Pasco, but if it's the same experience throughout, then maruti has made a long term customer. Mileage is around 14-15 in city, that's Gurgaon for me, with 12-14 kms daily drive. On highway it goes upto 16-17 too, but you've to drive very efficiently. Also love the fact that basics like temperature controlled cabin etc are available on base variants by default. Word of advice, if you are doubting the car, go and sit in it. Especially the back seat. That'll be the make or break moment for you.
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;5 Sep 2020;Sylesh Gopan;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;We started looking for a new car maybe towards Dec'19. I was always keen on having a compact /normal SUV. Options before us were Creta/ Harrier/ Seltos/ Brezza/ EcoSports. Obviously cost was a factor and thats why you see the range of options :). We started test driving some of these and thats when someone put the idea of XL6 into my mind. To be very frank I was not at all keen not sure why. But w e visited the showroom and saw the car and my daughter just stamped her choice. She was excited to see the 3rd row and was happy that we could take our dog along for trips without much space issues. After checking out XL6 the other options looked less appealing for the family mainly from the space perspective. We booked the Alpha automatic it in Mar but had to wait for delivery till Jul due the lockdown in between. Due to travel restrictions in Pune there wasnt much chance to drive it around even after delivery. Our 1st drive in essence was to Kerala, to our hometown. All in all below is what I liked and not liked about the car so far;Like - Space. Even the 3rd row is accessible and kids can have a gala of time there. - Feels premium - Got mileage of 15-16 km / l - 2nd row seat comfort - Ride comfort - Almost an innova with a huge price diff and premium feeling cabinet - Cabinet is insulated well, outside noise is well filtered - boot space is good even with 3rd row occupiedNot liked - Wheel size. Should have been 16' min - AT gearbox is good, but you may have to get used to it for overtaking mainly on a road without median. - Speakers where not that good for a vehicle at this range. There are less costly vehicle provided with co. fitted bose systems. I changed them with infinity speakers. Oem fitted speakers looked very low quality when i saw while changing.Overall real thumps up !!!
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;19 Oct 2020;Sriram Kasbe;4.3; Family Car ;Good car overall, Has its downsides with too soft dampers in the rear and on highway at 100-120 speeds any bridges will feel like the people in rear are in a rollercoaster.Looks wise better than ertiga any day, Also the cheapest premium car which looks sporty and premium and muv.Its a good combo, Especially the black mirros, Body panelling and the front quadra led lamps, More than enough bright li ght at night, you have to get used to it as it feels lacky than the orange halogens but the color difference is main as we are adjusted to the orange light and we feel a bit discomfort in white led.Other than that this car is paisa wasool.The economy depends on your riding and unlike other cars where even if you accelerate slow you get 15kmpl here you will easily get 22kmpl if you accelerate gently and keep gears changing, you can go 40kmph in 5th gear and with very less stress to the engine, It is a very usable car.
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;17 Nov 2019;Sandeep Gupta;4.7; Family Car;I took delivery of my XL6 in late August, and till date I have covered 2000+ kms in 3 months with mileage of >16 kmpl. I have upsized the tyres to Bridgestone Turanza 195/65 on the same R15 alloys, which has added well to the already smooth ride with even less road noise. Overall, except the lack of airbag protection for the middle row (and it's this row in XL6 which is being differentiated agains t Ertiga), I am very happy with XL6. This is a 100% family car, so do not expect much driving thrills. My other car is SX4, 2011 make, which is still much more fun to drive with it's 1.6L engine and R16 alloys, but with very poor mileage (any SX4 giving mileage >10 kmpl is fantastic).
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;25 Jun 2020;Anup Singh;4.7; Family Car;well!! I brought this car in diwali n today whenever I drive this car it feels like I driving new car the comfertableness is just mind blowing u will never feel tired in this car wheather u go for long drive...I have few problem that the wheels should more bigger n also the engine area should be cover with plastic of any material because whenever I take this car for wash I always get scared the wa ter should not get on battery of wireings..
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;15 Nov 2020;Vision X;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;it is basically a affordable version of innova also a muscled version of eartiga it is super comfy in all the three rows except for 3rd one for those who are more than 5'10''. yes that 103 Bhp may sound less but it is second highest in the competition and tires could have been bigger like 16 or maybe 17 inch. At the end of the day it offers a decent package that one will take back home everyday wi th a smile.
MarutiSuzuki;XL6;2 Dec 2020;Nikhil Pathak;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Nice car for family, comfortable good space mileage also good for a big car.... In short good car with all features at a low cost as compared to other cars in market. And from the most reliable company of India who knows Indian conditions better than anyone in the market. 4 captain seats make the difference in long distance travel... Good to buy
