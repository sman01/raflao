Volkswagen;Ameo;23 Nov 2020;Dharmendra D..;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;This is 4th year of my ownership.My usage has been limited to just over 23k kilometers during these years.Mostly used on long road trips between 300 to 2400 kilometers, Experience is rated at 3.5 actually, Out of 5.Simply for the maintenance cost which has been on a higher side.The model, Even though not well received by suzuki obsessed fellow indians, Does have believers like me.Feel the safest w hile driving.Have done sharp bends at 100 kmph leaving honda cities and innova behind.Never ever felt unsafe with this vehicle.Response to acceleration, Braking is little slow however, This is compensated on steep hill terrains where i don't even have to pull down to 4th gear at times.
Volkswagen;Ameo;30 Oct 2020;Khiladaexpro..;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours ;It is a performance car for individuals into sheer love for driving.Not at all a family car, Okay in comfort for backseaters, Superb comfort for the driver seating.If you wanna go for a beast car which gives you an experience of enthusiast for the love of driving, Then this car is for you ( go for dsg for the pleasure of racing on indian roads ).You can easily do 185 to 200, On highway, You won't know anything till 160, After 160 you would feel a bit fast on india expresss highways on speed breakers.As indian roads are never made for sheer love for driving cars, Just made for normal usage.And if you can't give around 12000 for service, Then this car is not for you, Because of performance you need pay such amount for service.
Volkswagen;Ameo;21 May 2020;Arun Prasad;3.7; Family Car ;Volkswagen ameo is absolutely top in performance and comfort. When features increase obviously there will a lag in milege. So mileage is less when compared. But comfort, style, features, everything else are top in segment. Cruise is one of the best in segment. Then power of engine. Then interiors, alloy wheels, tyres are just top. No words to describe. Best of it.

Volkswagen;Ameo;29 Jan 2019;Gokulindian;2.7; Daily Commute ;Buying experience - Huge promises during purchase after that Zero. Riding experience - Excellent long ride. Only for long ride and engine performance is good. Details about looks, performance etc - Look is ok. Only engine performance is good. Rest is bad. Very low height not good for rear passengers and people with good height. Servicing and maintenance- Worst Pros and Cons Pros - Good engine perf ormance and long ride. Cons - Worst service and after sales. parts not good. High cost for parts, all parts replacement , no repairs.
