Hyundai;Elantra;14 Sep 2020;Anurag Gangwar;3.3; Daily Commute ;very good product but liitle bit on the heigher price.ride quality is fantastic but again hyundai dealers are very poor in keeping the spares of this car.hyundai must think about the availabilty of the spare parts.fuel economy is really poor for a 125bhp car though elantra has super loaded with the amazing features which make this car really good in this segment.
Hyundai;Elantra;9 Aug 2020;Raj Upadhyay;4.7; Occasional Commute ;Very stylish looking car! It has a futuristic design and looks styled for the future. It has multiple features, however it has low clearance which is a concern. The other issue is low mileage in city conditions, however, on highways, it gives 17 Km/L.
