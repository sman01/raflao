Toyota;Yaris;6 Mar 2019;RAJESH S;3.0; Family Car ;Yaris is a family car, if you are giving priority to safety and comfort. As my last 8 months experience, safety and comfort is the positive things in Yaris. But this is an over priced car (For V-CVT variant, should pay about 15 Lakhs) and also it does not have any good features (Eg - Very Bad Infotainment System), So don"t go for a higher variant of this car, instead buy a lower variant and add ad ditional features whatever you need,Since this car have 7 Airbag and ABS included in all its variants. Regarding the mileage for Normal driving you will get 12 to 13 and in Traffic, it should be about 9 to 10.
Toyota;Yaris;1 Jul 2020;Rajesh Sahoo;4.7; Daily Commute ;My experience in this car is very good specially the riding comfort, suspension, turning radius is excellent. Look wise I like it than the other cars in same range. Regarding mileage with 1.5 L Gasoline engine I would say its performance is very good. I am getting between 13 to 14 in city drive. Overall I like it very much.
Toyota;Yaris;31 Oct 2018;Sls Babu;3.7; Daily Commute ;Yaris is great all round car but over pricing just killed it. Decent design inspired from Lexus at the front and Corolla at the back . Tyre size could have been 16 inch for v or vx variants ( they had given 185/60R15 for all variants , which is the default size of B segment ) . It looks like , they took out Etios engine, add more power , add more air bags and renamed with Yaris with astronomical p ricing. Interior space is decent . Ride and handling is also nice . Overall , except for J variants , other variants are simply over priced
Toyota;Yaris;14 Dec 2020;RAJESHWARI T..;2.7; Daily Commute ;Overall car is good well maintained & only major issue is mileage part which is too poor 8-9 that's all on highways it's a total fake promises by such a huge brand toyota kiroskar motors.Pls suggest how to increase the mileage 3rd service is upp.
Toyota;Yaris;19 Jan 2021;Debendra Dash;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Good car for long drive. Excellent driving comfort. Mileage within city limits are little less. However, overall its a good heavy sedan with large boot space.
Toyota;Yaris;10 Feb 2019;Sol Rudolf;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Amazing car. Ignore the reviewers, Indian buyers have been had again by the biased reviewers.The extra price over the competition doesnt matter as this a car you can keep for 10 years. Car is great for daily commutes, Toyota has tuned it for mileage but you can race if you drop a gear. Best in class build quality and suspension and ride quality and the most important - safety with 7 airbags in the only sedan costing 10.5 lakhs.
Toyota;Yaris;13 May 2019;Rahul Nair;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Yaris is carefully engineered for indian road conditions. Excellent ride quality and suspension. Performance is mediocre as you won"t feel the punch on initial gears. Higher gears are awesome..Overall i would say best car for family ride and touring

Toyota;Yaris;12 Feb 2019;Kishor M;4.7; Daily Commute ;Yaris gives good mileage when only 2 or 3 passengers travelling, and on high ways where we don't change gear for long time it gives very good mileage ranging from 16 to 18.
