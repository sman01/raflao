Tata;TiagoNRG;12 Apr 2019;DILEEP D;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Driven 3500 Km in a single ride, no problems at all, comfort, easy drive, excellent music system, AC is also good enough, little noisy engine but it is acceptable because of pure Indian like us. 4yrs extended warranty by Tata motors is great. Tata motors service team in overall India is doing a wonderful job because of their behaviour, technical qualification, experience and excellent customer re lation and need definitely to be appreciated. Feel a great experience with NRG as well as the service team. At the mileage side, when safety comes to mind there is no option to ask "kitna mileage" but I got 18km/l on highways and 13-14 in local drives and hope it will be increased after 1st engine oil change ie; the second service. The overall performance of the vehicle and Tata motors service are great and remarkable. I was in search of a little hatchback with sporty look, ground clearance, roof rails, dual tone colour, claddings, armour plate, rear spoiler etc with advanced safety features like Airbags, ABS, EBD and corner stability control etc since Aug 18, and proposed many cars in this segment, and finally choose NRG as the winner after its release on 12 Sep 18 and take test test drive. Hope, Tata Motors will release updates like rear cam, buzzers etc for this car soon. My final rating is 5/5 for NRG 5/5 for Team Tata Motors. Congrats...!
Tata;TiagoNRG;24 Mar 2019;Lucky Thacker;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I'm from a Small Village where Everyone has Mentality that Tata is not a Good Brand and Hyundai i20 and Suzuki Swift or Baleno are Only Good in Market.A lot of people Told us to Not Purchase Tata Product, But when everyone Experienced this Beauty, all of them were awestruck. 1 of My Father's Friend Already Planned to Purchase Tiago. And another one is Already Considering Harrier over Creta.Tiago N RG has very Smooth Drive Handling, We've Purchased Diesel Variant as My Father has Too Much Daily Running. Till Date Car Gave us Mileage of 20-24 kmpl which is beyond our Expectations. Also, This has The Toughest Car Body when compared with Segment.Major Plus Point of this Car is its Music System by Harman. MAN!!NONE OF THE CAR IN THIS SEGMENT OR UPPER SEGMENT HAVE SUCH GREAT SOUND QUALITY I CAN BET.A lot of Peoples says that Tata Car makes a lot of Noise and Vibrations. But That's not True with Its New Cars, I want to mention that You would Never ever Realise that Negligible Difference when Compared to Other Diesel Cars. Surely there's some Difference but Definitely not Remarkable.Frankly, I was a Tin ka Dabbas Fan Earlier but Tata Amazed Me with This Package
