Volvo;XC90;22 Jan 2019;Abhishek Pal..;5.0; Family Car | Occasional Commute | Tours ;Great styling and comfort. Very comfortable and adjustable 7 seater. Loved the minimalistic interior. Loved the MMI- SENSUS and interiors. Air suspensions are great with ride height adjustment, but we can feel the thuds on sharp pot holes. Also, could be more punchy / responsive engine on dynamic or comfortable mode.
