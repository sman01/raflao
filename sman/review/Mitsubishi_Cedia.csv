Mitsubishi;Cedia;18 Feb 2019;Amshuman Murali;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The Cedia is a complete car. Be it, family/friends. A perfect sedan which can take a lot of harsh treatment at good speeds. A very agile, swift and yet a stable vehicle. All I can say is that this car was killed without proper promotion and the car was way ahead of its time when it was introduced in the Indian Market.
