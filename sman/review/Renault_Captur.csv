Renault;Captur;14 Dec 2020;Anand Patil;5.0; Daily Commute ;We loved the captur, The day it was launched through ranver kapoor ad.But the price was a bit too high we thought.The look had mesmerized us.And in 2018 renault came up with an offer we could not refuse.Bought the platine model and dealer repainted the top in ivory as my wife wanted at his cost and we were on a trip to jaislemer from mumbai even before first service.Caotur performed very well.The high seating position was a confidence booster after driving hyundai accent for years.Before.Torque was always available when required.And 800 kms a day did not cause any soreness in body.I have fallen in love with my captur and driven it to all corners of maharashtra and recently to patiala.The car gives a decent mileage of 17.5 kms per liter of diesel.Service station is very good and offers pick up and drop services.And as the model is discontinued it becomes pride of a unique car.
Renault;Captur;28 Jun 2020;Allwyn Ferna..;4.7; Family Car;Renault captur RXT petrol with amazing features and affordable price.Hi, I am selling my car since I am not using it much though. Planning to take a hatchback. My car has been driven only 15400km in 2 years. Car is in a very good condition. It has an amazing Design with robust engine. It's smooth, spacious and much better performance than Hyundai creta. I am sure you won't get such kind of a car a t such a good price that I have given.
