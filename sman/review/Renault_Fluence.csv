Renault;Fluence;25 Aug 2020;Anil Sangle;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;The Renault Fluins car is great to look at and use. Very good and comfortable for the highway. But in India, it is difficult to get parts due to the closure of the car. Parts are expensive. Due to lack of service center nearby service is not available. Being a diesel tax is good. The pickup is pretty good.
