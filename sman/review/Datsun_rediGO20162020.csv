Datsun;rediGO20162020;10 Jan 2020;Yogesh Sharma;2.0; Daily Commute;`Very bad Dealer/Customer service I bought Redigo 2 Years Back, from that time I'm facing bad dealer/customer service from Dwarka Centre.4-5 Months back there was some problem of wiring in my car and I have visited teh dwarka service centre for reparing and servicing. They have repaired the wiring and everthing that I have complained But after that service the problems starts increasing in my Car. Car start virbrating / Race automatically goes high and low / Back Sensor stopped working / Average goes down / Avg Metre shows Zero sometimes.I have visited Centre after 1 Week of my last service and asked them to check the same. they just drove my car and said everthing is OK.Such a bad customer dealing was done by Datsun Curtomer Service Team. I'm still facing this issue and want to inform others also about my bad experienceI won't suggest anyone to buy Datsun Car in future.

Datsun;rediGO20162020;9 Dec 2018;;1.3; Occasional Commute ;A sincere review from a two month user(delivered on November 2018)Literally a life threatening car .The incident so happen in the middle of railway cross.The engine would make a crashing noise and stop all functions. You have to wait for a couple of minutes to restart the engine. After a couple of repeating events i took it for service centre (EVM NISSAN,Perinthalmanna,KERALA) and they changed sli p clutch point and programme And gave me assurance that it won"t repeat.But the engine couldn"t keep the promise and gave me a counted 7 times engine break down.3 times in the middle of the road and i was saved due to my lower speed and absence of vehicles behind.Thanks to god.I took it to service station slow and steady by the edge of the road due to fear because the problem is not periodic and comes anywhere anytime.
Datsun;rediGO20162020;27 Nov 2019;Hari Vignesh;4.0; Daily Commute ;This is a excellent under rated car with a standard and decant features such as single air bag, rear parking sensors etc.A car at this price point has has a good features. Safety wise it has a huge gap, eg- the material which has been used in this care is not up to the standard (built quality). Performance wise the car is 800 cc and for this caliber the car is giving a good punch

Datsun;rediGO20162020;20 Dec 2020;Vicky Sherpa;3.3; Family Car ;Mileage and comfort is good in redi go comparing other vehicle of the same ranges but after sales service is very worst, I would like to request datsun/nissan company to take customers complaints seriously regarding their particular underperforming service center if they want to increase sales in future.

Datsun;rediGO20162020;28 Aug 2019;Deepayan Dutta;5.0; Occasional Commute ;A very smooth ride experience with superb suspension and great rides on bad roads. Four speakers instead of two would have been great but the pricing is the most attractive. In built Bluetooth audio system works fine.
Datsun;rediGO20162020;8 Sep 2019;Aadil Shah;4.0; Daily Commute ;It"s a great car, but the interior build quality could have been a notch better. Specially the plastics used should be more refined. The current ones tend to make noises and get loose when driven often on our roads.
Datsun;rediGO20162020;23 Dec 2020;Sachin Bangar;5.0; Tours ;Overall best in class when compared to the cost in the segment.It's more than what imagined for the car.I travelled across the seven states.Single day 800 km.Max speed reached only twice 140 kmph.
Datsun;rediGO20162020;7 Dec 2018;Gautam Sharma;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;I bought redi-go 1.0 on April 1st 2018. On June 16, I took it too Lahaul Spiti. It"s high ground clearance helped me complete the circuit. The car did feel a bit underpowered at few points. But that was mainly because the incline was too steep. But it did climb up. So, good for me.
Datsun;rediGO20162020;2 Dec 2019;Vicky Bhargava;3.3; Daily Commute ;Good account, and mileage, though engine is bit weaker, aftersales service is horrible and due to this wont buy/recommend any nissan car in future
