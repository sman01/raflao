Mahindra;Scorpio;12 Sep 2019;JNithish Fdo;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The car I own is a 2.2 mHawk VLX Scorpio Makes 124HP and 290NM of Torque the highlight is that it"s an AT 6-Speed Borg Warner AT gearbox city Fuel economy 11KMPL highway fuel economy is 14KMPL and can be pushed up to 18 with Economic and conservative driving Adequate comfort and ample space Being a 7 seater the the last row isn"t meant for any person above 5"4 Love the audio Quality from the Stock Audio system which also has Bluetooth connectivity and a Mic for calls (Mahindra Radio)however I got a couple of Tweeters and speakers for an even better experienceThe top speed I reached is 176KMH while 0-100 takes 14s considering the fact that it"s a pretty Heavy AT SUV the timings impressiveIt feels even quicker while driving it It"s height is both a con and a pro as it"s height gives you that commanding feel and Safe over bumps potholes even with all 7 in place the height makes it a mission for older people to get in and get out The suspension is on the softer side Good over bumps but sometimes the ride feels on the Jerkier side (only in City)
Mahindra;Scorpio;12 Jan 2020;Hemant Kumar;4.0; Occasional Commute ;I have been using scorpio s10 4wd since 2017nov, and the first thing i've noticed in this beast that door's noise keeps you irritate,it won't going to stop not even in agency, and you will have to use to it, and second thing I've noticed that i got a milage of 7 km per litre in hills and 12 - 13 km per litre in long drive, seats are like you will have to compromise with them, and no storage in thi s suv, like there are only 2 bottle space at rear doors and only 1 bottle space in front on gear console, there are no storage in front doors, can't even place your smart phone or wallet anywhere properly, and this suv comes with the cheapest quality 17inches MRF tyres that is going to run only 20,000kms, but instead on these cons this suvs performance is really good, and the 4wd feature is so amazing, trust me if you love off-roading then this suv will makes you fall in love with this beast...but mahindra need to work alot on the features,storage and comfort, at last i will just say that instead of so much cons i still love this beast.

Mahindra;Scorpio;12 Sep 2020;Mr;3.7; Tours | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;The performance of this car is obviously good, but the lock down started within 5 days from the date of my purchasing of this car, I have not used it much, for sharing my experience, But my concern is that I have purchased a S9 variant, Your website and all other leading sites are saying that S9 variant has a Navigation system inbuilt, But I am not being able to find this in my Car, even my dealer also saying that It does not comes with S9 variant, I would like to ask the writer of this article, that from where you have got this information that S9 has a Navigation system in it, If the reviewer has seen any of the S9 with a Navigation system, please let me know that, Please let me know that how to install the navigation system in S9 variant, even after purchasing the vehicle, Regards, Sanjit Saha, Siliguri, West Bengal.
Mahindra;Scorpio;14 Nov 2020;Mr. india;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;We used it for many years but sold it. Its pickup made the drive fun. It reaches the full 180 kmph mark on highways, that’s kinda impressive but It’s brakes were not powerful though on a car like Scorpio. It’s cruising speed was usually 80-90 kmph bcoz of its low mileage .Mileage on highways was 11.5 kmpl and city mileage was 9 kmpl. It was very spacious and airy. It was a bouncy car. It had low maintenance and easy to repair car. Resale value was decent but not that great as there were many more models in Scorpio which were eating each other’s resale value (people preferred m2di or vlx model rather than 2.6 turbo) Miss that car though. U ll love it if u drive it :-)
Mahindra;Scorpio;6 Mar 2020;Ashutosh Shukla;3.3; Daily Commute ;scorpio has great road presence and it feels like king of the road while driving . I got captain seat version but the space was always issue.. if you have more than two bahas it has be 4 seater only and if we were 5 then no luggage space.. one more area it was bot so good was driving ergonomics got my elbow hurt many times by door.. spending 15 lacs on it was bot a great decision but got very good resale value.so no regret..miss that king feeling.
Mahindra;Scorpio;2 Dec 2020;MV Rao;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Scorpio is made to match the grueling roads of india and especially rural india.It is my family car for long and short rides in around my city.I have done 1, 98.760 km since i bought it.It helped me in my city's disaster time of terror bombings to reach the victims to hospitals.I worked for emergency management and research institute at hyderabad.It is more than value for money rather paisa vasool vehicle.
Mahindra;Scorpio;10 Mar 2020;Desai Sanjay;5.0; Family Car ;I used mahindra scorpio from May 2012 to Jan 2020, Recently I sold this car.Very good exterior and interior design & best economical cars in SUV type.Good experience for long drive and hills area.Personally I feel scorpio is my family member, In future I will purchase scorpio only.If anyone wants to purchase SUV type car, I recommend scorpio cars only.

Mahindra;Scorpio;2 Jun 2020;Bahuleyan Pi..;2.3; Family Car ;Feeling very safe while driving and comfort. Bad thing is Tyre wear and tear is more.best things is the driving comfort and wide vision and will not put you in trouble.Mileage is very poor, car pick up is very poor, Build quality to be improved a lot.vibration comparatively less, in my model features are very less.After sale service is very bad.
Mahindra;Scorpio;16 Oct 2020;Nikhil Franco;3.0; Occasional Commute ;Putting my foot on the throttle always brings smile on my face.The pickup of the car is phenomenal.The drawbacks to it are the tough steering.You can get a workout out of driving the scorpio even though it has power steering.Also the after sales service is pathetic in goa.Sad that a well built car cannot get the service it deserves.
Mahindra;Scorpio;2 Jan 2020;Shashanka Ch..;3.3; Family Car | Tours;I have waxed eloquently about my experience with the car on my posts in your forum and i feel that I need not continue over & over again!Enough to say that, despite its shortcomings, the Scorpio lived up to its reputation as a highly competent SUV, with huge street cred, and an enviable reputation in the motoring community.
Mahindra;Scorpio;3 Jul 2020;Sankalp Singh;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Trustworthy beast that has stood the test of time and never let me down. A bit difficult to maintain and maybe missing the finesse of foreign cars but I have driven it under all Indian conditions all over the country for more than 10 years and has been very comfortable and reliable for my family of 4. Plus it looks badass.
Mahindra;Scorpio;29 Oct 2020;Varughese Oo..;4.3; Family Car ;In the madness called driving in kerala, You need a vehicle with road presence to ward off all the nuisance that comes with driving - hence my choice was the scorpio.It has long distance driving comfort and very reliable.So add to that the safety factor then your choice is perfect.
Mahindra;Scorpio;1 Sep 2019;Moto Line;4.0; Family Car ;I bought the scorpio because it was my dream car from my childhood.......

Mahindra;Scorpio;3 Jan 2019;Amrith Nambiar;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;It is a wonderful car to drive but lacks on comfort and is a bit too scary to drive on corners and it also lacks high end punch. In city driving the performance is awesome. Ergonomics is not the best. Space is plentiful. The suspension is very bad and is very jumpy even though an aftermarket suspension will fix the problem they are expensive. Overall quality is not the best even though it is somet hing you will not notice given the USA of the car
Mahindra;Scorpio;30 Dec 2020;Vidya Sagar;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Scorpio is good for long drives. We have been to various places with scorpio no break down anywhere. The everything of our belongings can be carried in this vehicle. The one of the best car for Indian roads.
