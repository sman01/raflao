Volkswagen;Polo20152019;2 Sep 2019;Piyush Jain;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The car is superb,we are chilled after a cooling of 10 minutes by the A.C, gives a mileage of 19.5 kmpl on highway and around 15 kmpl in city. Leg space,boot space,luggage space everything is GREAT and music system is also very good.The negative point is only that it have only 2 airbags in highline model,but it"s powerful body can bear anything. After sales service of this car is not so appreciabl e.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;19 Aug 2020;Jknaidu;3.7; Daily Commute ;It is a driver's care. We are 100 percent happy. We are extremely happy about it. The auto transmission DSG is ultimate . If mileage is another 2 to 4 km more then no car can beat it. We have duster,Ford Figo and Honda City Diesel. But my favourite choice is POLO GT TSI always .. For total family.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;11 Oct 2020;Naeem Muhammed;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Best in class mileage , safety , build quality, driving experience, handling , driving experienceðŸ’ž And tension free maintenance period yearly once or 15k km ðŸ˜Š, peace of mind WARRANTY package up to 6 years or 150000km ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.

Volkswagen;Polo20152019;10 Aug 2019;Siva Prabhu;3.3; Occasional Commute ;I gifted to my wife.Expensive car and high maintenance cost.If they want to fight with Hyndai or Toyota then seriously they must reduce maintenance cost.No issue of 5 years 56k drive.Very smooth but 3 cylinder lack sudden pickup!!!!!which feels very bore.Once get cruise,awesome.I reached even 150 kmph nothing feels...no vibration.Cons : A/c feel very down and mileage if u drive more than 120,u wal let will be thin.A Simple 4 seater family car to drive for city and 200 km long drive.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;6 Nov 2020;Abhishek Lal;5.0; Daily Commute;The Polo is one of the most iconic and fascinating car I've ever come across in this particular segment. Its an honour to have one. Mine is 3rd stage remapped and it goes superb with this car model. The dynamics are equally, significantly and overwhelmingly exceptional.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;18 Apr 2019;Sachin Shende;4.7; Daily Commute ;Owns a tdi and the car is Typically German... Built like a tank drives like an airplane.Easy to drive through tight spaces but let the tiny stance not fool you as this car can do some serious speeds which could shame even a couple of sedans above it"s segments add the precise handling and in the right hands she"s gonna cruise like a torpedo :)Love the built quality which is above par with the segm ent and a few segments above.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;23 Jan 2019;Mayur Satish;3.7; Daily Commute ;Polo gt tsi-- the car don"t have a great mileage and as u drive in sport mode performance is at high level but mileage disappoints. Comfort is Best in class. It"s made up of high quality finish and material. Finally it is a German car so safety & comfort, built quality is the best at it"s level. But you have to sacrifice for price maintenance and efficiency it is one of the best premium hatchback in India.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;11 Dec 2019;Saurabh Sharma;3.0; Daily Commute;Its fun to drive car, not for tall people surely, not enough space in rear seats, not enough power in the engine... Accelerates slowly, but very stable at high speed, feels like full of confidence while driving a polo
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;15 Jan 2019;Vansh Singh;4.0; Daily Commute ;Pros -Safest car in the price range , sophisticated styling and good performance.Cons - Spare parts are rare . WORST PART - car relies heavily on ecu and pcm , the fault codes are misleading and if you get stuck , you are doomed to be hopeless!Overall - Good for 5 years , post that sell the car ASAP , or be ready to have mechanics at your speed dial and browser history full of TDI forums !
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;23 Aug 2019;Farook Muhammed;4.3; Family Car ;The vehicle has very good stability & ride comfort. The main drawback with the Petrol manual model is its 3 cylinder engine & rear legroom. Otherwise the VW Polo is a VFM vehicle.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;14 Feb 2019;Muhammed K;3.3; Daily Commute ;The polo which I have is POLO highline petrol , full loaded. The exterior and interior are superb , It has good control even in thr high speed drive.But am not satisfied with the power delivery and milage. The bhp is belly 80, which means the car will struggle to speed up. And the average milage for me is 10km / Ltr to 11.5 km / Ltr.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;20 Jul 2019;Raju Manne;4.3; Occasional Commute;Polo is awesome vehicle with little high cost on maintenance. It cannot be compared with any other car in this segment. Once you drive polo I am sure you would not like to drive any other hatchback car... It"s performance is awesome and if you can extent your budget a little buy GT. It"s a pleasure
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;2 Jan 2019;KS Pixe;5.0; Family Car ;I have a polo 1.2L highline and IMO it is a very good family budget car. It has superb built quality and in terms of premium feel, fit and finish this car is eons ahead of segment competitors. And most importantly itâ€™s the perfect Driverâ€™s car as advertised.
Volkswagen;Polo20152019;17 Feb 2019;Purshotham R..;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Great to drive.Good even on rough roads, very sturdy/solid and safe (ABS,2airbags)Comfortable (climate control AC, Bluetooth,etc)Minus points:High cost of spares, also not easily available in small cities,and serviced only at the Volkswagen centres.
