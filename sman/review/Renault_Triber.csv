Renault;Triber;26 Sep 2020;Amit Naithani;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Completed around 5 thousand kms on this car.. I own a bs6 manual rxt...on road price in noida was 7.24 in Feb 20...driven on highways, hills of uttarakhand, in noida city in traffic. In city I am getting mileage of around 14 on highways it increases to 19.. it cruises smoothly on highways.. very stable even at high speeds of 120+ except for the slight body roll. I took it max to 140. It however ta kes time to reach top speeds and is not the quickest of the cars.. but I don't mind it much... Ride quality is very good and it feels quite comfortable even on rough terrains thanks to the good suspension and high ground clearance.. on hills too I drove it with 6 people on board and it climbs up without any issues.. however the engine note is loud when I rev it too much.. due to three cylinder engine I suppose. the interiors are pretty nice .. infotainment console , air-conditioning all is perfect with vents in all three rows! The all digital instrument cluster is very useful and intuitive.. the gear shift indicators, door open warning, lights on warning all are very useful.. next coming to space its a king of space after you remove the third rows completely.. I could fit in two adult size bicycles on my recent trip which was so much fun later on.. imagine going on a trip with your bicycles with you in your car.. unbelievable.. now coming to the cons... I don't like the door locks which are like from the first generation cars.. and the antenna which looks too long but we can certainly remove if we don't need.. the car shudders in reverse gear if there is a slight slope and you need to give more throttle to avoid that... I think we need to get used to the car clutch setting and understand it to get the best out of it...and the AC fan noise is loud from outside.. you won't know it from inside but someone outside will certainly hear the noise the ac makes...Rest all is good.. I must also say that noida sector 62 staff is very courteous and I have no complains so far.. my first service was totally free and so far the car has been loyal and touch wood I have not faced a single issue.. I think anybody who is not too performance savvy can go for it..
Renault;Triber;14 Nov 2019;Sushant Main;5.0; Occasional Commute;Renault Triber is an exciting car, I purchased it on 10th Nov 2019. For RXZ Model with 15' Tyre it cost me Rs. 8.11 Lakcs on road in Mumbai. (Paid Rs. 5,500/- extra for the Tyre upgrade)It comes with essentials features like Reverse Camera, 2nd and 3rd row Air Condition vents, infotainment system with Apple Carplay and Android Auto, key-less entry, DRLs, etc. What more can you expect at this price ?Why Renault Triber?We are a family of three, at times my parents joins us and occasionally it is my brother's family. So we wanted a car which can accommodate 6 people and 2 kids for occasional travel. Triber gives me a flexible option of converting it from 5 seater to 7 seater when we have extra family members. I wanted a big family car with basic to advanced features, if you compare it with competition, you would have to shell out 10+ lakh rupees easily. Triber gave me a good balance between budget and expectations. It also gives my family an option to travel together instead of traveling in two different cars.Which features I miss in Triber?1. Automatic Climate Control2. Automatic TransmissionThese features are not deal breaker. Renault Triber is coming up with Automatic model, I am assuming that it should have Climate Control as well.Car Performance?Its too early to comment on the car performance, maintenance cost and mileage. I am expecting it to give me around 13 kmpl; I will be in a position to comment on this after the first service.Who should buy Triber?The answer depends on how often you travel with full load of 6 to 7 members. Then you will have to perform cost-benefit analysis. For a family of 5, with couple of members joining you occasionally, I think Triber is the best option at the given price. Is engine power an issue?I do not know (yet). If Ecco can take a load of 8 people then why not Triber?
Renault;Triber;15 Sep 2020;Subham Jayne;1.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Worst car.....in just 3 months i have filed 8 complaints against this car .......I bought it in a new condition and after 2 months it start giving me so many problems like break fail, tyre get cracked at the speed of 40-50kmph, engine get dislocated, engine gets fired up, all of sudden engine stops working in the middle of the road and more over worst customer care services when I called them for a solution they told me that you don't know how to drive, from past 12 years I'm driving the car and they telling me i don't know how to drive.... instead of providing me a solution they just keep on blaming me again and again. Saved my family from a major accident just because of this poor car have so many glitches and faults. The company name instead of Renault should be Re-Fault. Worst Car please don't buy this poor product from a poor company

Renault;Triber;12 Jan 2021;Nitesh S;5.0; Family Car ;I bought renault triber rxz on 08-10-2020 from pps wagholi.My odometer reading was 1200 when we started our first long trip.We had gone from pune to varanasi via ujjain, Bhopal, Sagar, Reva and return to pune via jabalpur, Raipur and nagpur.Total distance i traveled is around 3700 km in twelve days and the driving experience was good.In ghats, Triber performed well.Maximum speed i drove my triber is 120km/h and the car performance was good.Fuel average i got was around 18.3 km/l.Car was performing very good in bad roads also.No complaints till now with the vehicle.With this budget, This car is a good deal.
Renault;Triber;3 Dec 2019;Prasoon Sury..;2.3; Daily Commute;Ghost acceleration in lower gears. When you apply clutch to shift gear from 1st to 2nd and from 2nd to 3rd a lot of your fuel gets burned without your knowledge. This is the key reason for very poor mileage on lower gears 9-10kmpl Search google for Renault Triber real user review Average mileage 9 to 10.5 kmpl to know about 15 issues that I found.If your daily driving condition is in moderate to h eavy traffic or on hilly areas, what you will get will be around 10kmpl. Custom Tuning the engine for optimal performance cannot be done as it requires a software update from Renault.
Renault;Triber;11 Sep 2019;Somashekar R..;5.0; Tours;I did a test drive of the vehicle. Powerful engine. We were 6 people on board, with AC on, pulled easily in 2 gear from 7kmph. 35 to 100+ in 4th gear was also easy. Most important thing is it is not kwid"s 1 litre engine. Its an ENERGY innovation combined with dual vvt. Intelligent gear ratios maintain optimum rpms throught the rev range. Ride and handling is a benchmark. Renault was supplying eng ines to Rolls Royce. In india, Renault-Nissan provide engines to Benz A class vehicle. Think about their potential. Triber is a superb car. Well done Renault
Renault;Triber;8 Sep 2020;Jitesh;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car;Everything is great ❣️ except Mileage and Fan noise. In traffic or bad road conditions (9 KMPL) and on smooth roads or highway (not more than 13 KMPL). Fuel consumption is extremely high. Fan noise is annoying when you power on AC. It can be heard from buildings away. Disappointed with these 2 issues.
Renault;Triber;29 Dec 2019;Shekhar Ganolia;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car;I am using my car in my daily routine. I always go my office from triber. Daily up down 40 km. there is no space for cng. Only 82 ltr. Boot space with 7 seater. Average is 13 kmpl. in city and highway is 16-18. Car performance in best in city and highway.
Renault;Triber;27 Jul 2020;Syed Saqlain;5.0; Daily Commute ;Very happy with the purchase of Renault triber. I was expecting they would do some compromise on the car , but no , the interior is very good , spacious and comfortable. The car offers a lot of value . I have the rxt variant which is good value
Renault;Triber;11 Dec 2020;;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am really happy that I chose Triber RXZ AMT (White) which is unarguably best car in its price segment. This is the most flexible car around. Renault is going to be the next accepted brand in Indian market with Triber and its upcoming cars.
Renault;Triber;7 Jul 2020;FUSE OFFICIAL;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Nice car at this range but if you buy it boot space is very low when all 7seats are full but if you use it as a 5 seater car it will be amazing experience if you go for traveling you will get a sporty feel
Renault;Triber;23 Aug 2020;Shaik Jaha;4.3; Family Car ;Highly good car for City perpous driving maybe Big families or small... only one minuce point that is mileage, I came to know that hardly it gives12to14 kmph in city area & 15to16kmph on high ways

Renault;Triber;25 Nov 2019;RK Tech;2.3; Daily Commute | Tours ;After the initial hiccups in first and second gear the car do not give problem in 3rd and 4th gear up to speed of 80 km per hour. However if you try to pull it above 80, it struggles a bit.
Renault;Triber;23 Dec 2020;Mohan Babu;5.0; Daily Commute ;Nice nice nice.Pickup because it's not a silly 1000cc engine but it's an energy dual vvt engine, Comfort looks everything surprisingly good.Cant get in the globe a 7 seater for 6 lakhs is.
Renault;Triber;1 Jul 2020;Miziuddin Qazi;1.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Not worth even if cheap. noisy engine. cabin vibrations. cracking sounds all around after few days. seat distortion after use. poor cooling. AMT is worst. please avoid. my humble request.
