MercedesBenz;MClass;1 Dec 2020;PREMIUM ACCO..;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;The car looks a bit old model with the stepney at the back and the lights thar blunt without any sharp edges ... Overall the performance is very nice with good mileage and also the seating is very comfortable but it lacks a new age music system having an only option of CD's , the boot space and luggage space at the back is large.
