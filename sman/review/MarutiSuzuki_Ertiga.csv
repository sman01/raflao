MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;1 Oct 2019;Zhmal Subha;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;I own NEW ERTIGA ZXI plus 5 months old, the car is nice to drive on highways long run. Good 7 seater at the budget of below 12 lakhs .Whern we drive with care and place at 5th gear below or nearly 100 on speed we get good mileage till 18 KMPL but an average of 15 KMPL on long run . I have a request to MSI - that the car been purchased early 2019 are BSIV . We the buyers of that session would like to place a request to MSI - to recall the cars and convert them to BS6 at some nominal cost options plus add LED DRL front and back will boost the car sales definitely by after sales care for the customers with update versions thus will add recommendations from existing customers to new buyers for MSI cars and continued customer care.

MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;7 Aug 2020;Nandan Syam;4.0; Family Car ;I own a 2019 ertiga petrol the sound of the revs is just phenomenal and the performance is also adequate it has got all the necessary features most of them also miss on auto head lamp wipers and dimming mirrors the comfort of all the rows are amazing the problems are tyres appear to be in smaller size considering the size of the vehicle and the mileage is very low i get only 10kml on city drives w ith AC on and 13 kml on highway even though the claimed mileage is 19 kml
MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;19 Sep 2020;Tadvi Narendra;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I am using Ertiga VXI BS6 model from last one year. Overall good ,pick up is good. Car is running in City area ,so, mileage is around 12.5 to 13 kms. Ertiga is very good option for low cost MPV, space is also good. But body is very light, needs improvement in roof structure. Disappointing thing is that door glass cleaning wiper also not coming with VXI model. Feels difficult in rainy season. I kno w we can fit it from market,but this is also necessary.
MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;14 Dec 2019;Sunil Kumar;2.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Poor NVH, Lot of wind noise and engine noise creeps in at speed above 7 kmph.Worst mileage, only 16 on highways driven at less than 80 kmph and only driver seated. Seat comfort is stolen away by the poor NVH level. Your ears will get tired after a long drive. But steering is very light and easy to drive in city.
MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;11 Aug 2020;Kannan Sachivan;4.3; Family Car ;I OWN THE ERTIGA VXI AND IT PERFORMS WELL. WE ARE GETTING 12 KMPL AS A BEGINNING MILEAGE FROM THE ERTIGA VXI PETROL MANUAL VERSION.

MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;29 Oct 2020;Jeevanpal Singh;3.0; Family Car ;I own a 2019 ertiga petrol from may 2019, Its mileage is 13.7 km/ltr . mileage never increase why ? company said 19k/L but it is still 13.7 on 70-80 km/h speed. if speed increase 100+ then mileage is 9-11 km/L. everything is good in this car but issues is only mileage.
MarutiSuzuki;Ertiga;4 Sep 2020;Sumit Chauhan;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Maruti Suzuki Ertiga is a perfect family car.
