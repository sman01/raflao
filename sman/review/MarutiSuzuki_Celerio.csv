MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;30 Apr 2020;Vansh Gautam;5.0; Family Car ;Our Datsun Go completed its 4.5 years in January 2019,and we were quite bored with the old car.We were looking for a compact automatic car which could also be used by the ladies in the house.We zeroed in on the smallest automatic available in the Indian market...Alto K 10 AMT. The Maruti guys were called home and we did the booking for Alto K10 AMT.The research was still going on weighing the pros and cons.It was always on the back of my mind that there will be no premium feature even in the top trim.We still had some time so I searched for the next small thing which was Celerio.Now the features which distinguish it from tiny Alto are R 14 tyres, Anti lock braking system (ABS) ,Rear Wiper , all four power windows and bigger cabin which means comfortable seating and storage spaces.All this came at a price of just 1.5 lacs over the earlier choice so we immediately called the dealer and asked him if we could change our selection, and he was more than happy and called this as a fine decision making by us.Now on the delivery day I bargained for the leather steering cover and the leather seat covers which took little extra time in the handover but it was worth.The cabin is quieter, air conditioning is comfortable even in very high ambient temperature conditions.Music system is awesome with bluetooth connectivity , 4 speakers and steering mounted audio controls.Gear shifts in amt mode are smooth.Torque and power are good enough for the size of the car.Ground clearance and suspension is good to take any terrain.ABS allows very good short distance braking.Front , rear window wipers and defogger provides an efficient system to tackle heavy weather be it rain,dust or cold.Talking about more premium features it has automatic speed sensing door locks, seat belt warning for driver and front passenger, high speed warnings, door ajar warning, automatic cabin light, creep function which is disabled if there is an ajar door.For safety there are 2 airbags in front as opposed to only 1 in the The Alto K10 top trim.It's been a little over 1 year and I am still amazed with the choice I made.Overall it is a thrilling yet economical option.Don't think twice just go for it.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;26 Aug 2020;Shrikant She..;4.7; Daily Commute ;Purchased for city commute and occasional highway drive because it had better looks than Wagon-r. On petrol the mileage in city is around 18-20 and on highway 21-23(again depends on driving style). But in CNG the mileage in city is 22-25 and on highway its around 26-30(speed must be in between 80-100). Interior is average, not very basic not too fancy. Gets 2 airbags but lacks high speed stability due to less kurb weight. Engine performs really well, there is lag in the bottom end but really picks up pace after 3000rpm. I drove it at around 150kmph on petrol and 130kmph on CNG. Reliability of engine is good, doesnt burn much oil even if the car is on CNG mode for months(good practice is to drive it on pertol for 15-20km once a week). Speaking of built quality, its the same as expected from a maruti car. It rattles and squeaks on bad roads but is silent on good roads. Braking is not good nor bad but decent and ABS works well(only engages on places it should). Comfort too is decent for front as well as rear passengers compared to Wagon-r as the rear seats in celerio are not upright(not in kind of bench format). One can easily cover 350+kms without a break. Gearbox too is slick shifting and perfectly matches with the rev happy k10B engine(just judders a bit in reverse gear). Talking about sales and services the my celerio VXI(optional) varient costed me 5.71lakh (18thousand extra for passenger side airbag and ABS which is now mandatory in every car). Sales are good as parts and service stations are available in almost every city of India. The first major paid service costed me 5,516rs after 13000km(which is not bad as oil, oil filter, cabin air filter, intake filter, throttle body cleaning, replacing all spark plugs, wheel alignment and balancing, etc was done). According to me its better alternative than Wangon-r in all aspects. Thank you
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;23 Mar 2020;Karanveer Singh;1.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;IT WILL NOT GIVE YOU MILEAGE BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT DUE TO MILEAGE AND ALSO TRY TO BUY MANUAL OVER AMT.I AM GETTING MILEAGE OF 14,15 IN CITY AND 18,19 ON HIGHWAY.YOU'LL HAVE TO BE REALLY LIGHT ON FOOT TO GET MILEAGE.Try to go for more powerful car LIKE SWIFT PETROL OR WAGONR 1.2 PETROL(BODY IS THERE).If you're looking for a car in which you get instant acceleration.Good performance than it not for yo u.Once at speed of 30 my car hit ford Figo (nothing happened to it) but my front bumper came out with several cracks and fender bend.Once again a dog instantly came in infront of my car at speed of 60 kmh and then it hit him a little and my grill +crack on bumper +fog lamp position and bumper was lowered by that.Not satisfied with this car at all.After this I am buying another but not Maruti at all very bad build quality.Service experience is all really bad and they don't listen to you.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;2 Oct 2020;Prakash R;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;About Celerio X zxi: 1. Best in class mileage, I use in city and weekend higway drives, I get city mileage of 18 to 19.2kmpl and in highway average 20.5 to 21.4 (speed below 90kmph)2. Cost: Service cost after all the free services, they charge 4k (including1500/- for engine oil too)3. Comfortable: Comfortable for 4 heavy people. and the drive is butter smooth.4. Power: Drive is butter smooth, but it lacks power for immediate pickup.5. Speed: As I tested its top speed till 165kmph, but feeling uncontrolled and scary after 145kmph, untill then it looks planted.Overall, best city and long drive car for 5 people. But power does not come immediately, it takes time when car is fully loaded.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;17 Feb 2020;Dr Hemant;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Excellent car, ride quality, handling & response of engine is awesome. cabin is airy & spacious.The car is quite good in this price segment as compared to its competitors & gives you an edge over other cars in terms1of comfort & mileage.I own a celerio & I have driven it more than 110000 kms without any glitch.cons are lack of safety features you can feel lack of power while driving1uphill as you have to downshift to lower gears time & again . overall a very good car
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;5 Jan 2020;Cool Rider25;3.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;The celerio is such an awesome commuting car, i also use it for touring from home city to working city on weekends, performance is also good, for being such an economic car, my one and only hope is that maruthi will raise their bar on safety , because each and everyday people die due to unsafe cars, cars being poor quality in terms of safety. really they have to consider people as their family and build cars, otherwise i am happy about the driving experience
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;15 Nov 2019;Farrukh Merc..;2.3; Daily Commute ;Suspension is not so Good. A/c cooling coil failed one day after warranty expired and company did not approve. Clutch Judder continues even after Clutch replacement. Hord Pad cracked Company says its normal. Pickup is very poor. Good car for city as I have taken AMT Zx version average in petol is14/15 kmpl with a/c in City.MRF tyres have good life just crossed 80,000 kms in 4 years. RSA service is poor. Exide reaches before Maruti Road side Assistance.

MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;24 Aug 2020;Narendran K;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Its a value for money car, at 5.5 L on road, you will get a decent car with basic features like air bag, good space, phone controls on the steering wheel, head room(as it is a tall boy). Performance wise, its ok to have a 1000cc which is sufficient for a city traffic. at the same time it is manageable in travels upto 400kms at a stretch.long story in short - normal indian family budget car
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;23 Mar 2019;Gautam Gupte;3.3; Daily Commute ;Bought AMT for city driving comfort and also for once a month long drive. Not happy with Celerio's AMT - It gives lot of knocking compared to any AT car (maybe that's a problem with all AMTs). Also the shock absorbers of Celerio is not good to give you a comfortable drive, so it gives lot of jerks at back seat. The auto gear shift too takes lot of trouble when you really raise the car in case you are in a hurry and want to rush. e.g. if you raise it from 1st gear, it would go to 2nd gear probably when you cross 40 km/hr. So basically its not smart. But it a good vehicle for city driving.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;18 Dec 2019;Praveen Pras..;3.3; Family Car ;This car is only people with limited budget car is very smooth easy to ride Good pick up Gives me mileage of 15KMPL city ride .Cons are : very poor build quality light weight can't feel safe on highway only top variant has all safety feature overall good car if safety can be overlooked with whatever STD safety feature
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;18 Sep 2020;Krishna Dev;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Good car, best mileage, enjoyed driving, CNG pickup is also great. Love the comfort. Top notch. Smooth Driving. Best in this budget, wonderful look. Big tyre so less bumps. My Celerio is s Nov. 2019 Model but due to the lockdown was nit able to drive for too far. But till now .. I have enjoyed this Car..
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;15 Aug 2020;;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;good...1. road balancing on tilting the car.2. spacious3. easy to handle.bad...1. low initial (sudden) pick up on signals.2. front nearby terrain view difficulty on parking.3. blind spot on right turing curves on central line of road by right A pillar when driver seat is in comfort distance.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;10 Jul 2020;Anil Desai;2.3; Daily Commute;car is very good in all factors. but after sales service by sai service borivali is hopeless and they have no respect and care for their customers. quality of staff is not as aniticipated from a company lile maruti. they have robbed off my moneys for very dissatisfactory repair work.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;5 Jul 2019;Rishi Ragaa;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;For the beginers,daily commute, or female drivers just go to choose celerio is best car and k10 engine is insufficient power to drive in highway but in city driving power was adequate...inside the cabin plastics materials are average quality...if you go to top varient its features good..buy top varient model better (zxi (O))good thing is less maintenance, adequate cabin room for 5 passangers, comf ort travelling, not much body rolling of passengers due to its shock observes good.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;10 Nov 2020;VIKAS MARAN;3.3; Daily Commute;I have a diesel engine zdi 2016 and it puts a smile on my face delivering a 26kmpl mileage with a spacious inside and top end version media and audio system. just lacks with power and that is practical. all the way a Happy Celerio owner compare k10 or i10.

MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;15 Jan 2019;Valentine Th..;3.3; Daily Commute ;Celerio is good for milage and city drive. Even on highway its performance is good gives more milage than on record. Its build up and color are very weak. Lot of cabin noise. Boot space is sufficient, plastic used in the car is cheap. Slightly costly vxi model looking to features and safety points. Driving is smooth and pock up better than the new Santr. You don"t feel you are driving 1l car.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;10 Nov 2020;Salil Devji;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;if you want budget friendly with extra space in this is your pick in comparison to the rival cars from the same segment. i mean it has got more space than swift which is segment above from same manufacturer

MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;17 Apr 2019;Rajat Jain;4.3; Daily Commute ;Great car to buy as your 1st car - I opted for the manual gearbox - being light weight it provides great agility in driving, but am amazed at how silent the car is and yet have spent virtually nothing on engine or chasis maintainence in past 5 years.
MarutiSuzuki;Celerio;17 Feb 2019;Shahid Ali;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;It"s an excellent vehicle with zero maintenance cost. The engine is smooth and the car is ideal for city commutes.
