Tata;Tigor20172020;31 Mar 2019;Sanjay Kumar;4.3; Family Car ;Hello everybody. I purchased xz+ on 28th March, drove straight way for about 150 km on highway in the night. Pros - Got 22 km mileage, Excellent comfort seating, Lights are very good, Suspension superlative, Music by Harman world class. Cons - Engine a bit noisy, AC noisy but very effective at low rpm, even Apple car play missing, DRL missing, Rear armrest without a string for pulling it outside A C vents, simple looking with low quality adjustable nobs. At the very start of engine, a typical irritating noise comes out for a second. During drive at 80 km speed a burning smell, which I could not figure out. Two times happened. Conclusion, excellent buy keeping all the positive and negative in mind at such price, no other cars stands even near to it except Ford Aspire. Lastly build quality of Tigor is really marvellous. Hope to see the service part standing postive also. Tata motors must keep a bird's eye on it if it has to deliver consistently in the market. Within fortnight I shall be experiencing the service aspect.
Tata;Tigor20172020;23 Oct 2020;Manoj Das;5.0; Family Car ;Good all-round car.Only negative is that of the road noise which is audible inside the cabin.Since it has a 3 cylinder engine, So engine noise is evident.I did not have much knowledge about cars when i bought it.May be i would have bought another company car had i known this things before.
Tata;Tigor20172020;19 Jun 2019;Ashish Panchal;2.3; Family Car ;Customers should not buy the Tigor, even my suggestion customers should not by Any TATA motors products,as after sales they dont care about the customers, i purchased vehicles 20 days back i have worst experience, not good in brake down services . dont have spare at dealership, not able to provide temp vehicle once your vehicle in accident claim. mileage is just 12 in AMT. after complain in TATA m otors no revert from any one. unprofessional company with out having any understanding of customers requirement.
Tata;Tigor20172020;21 Dec 2019;Sanjeev Deka;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Tigor truly gives you a very premium quality interiors and A1 level driving comfort. Suspension in Tigor is of next level, no other car in same price range gives you similar experience.Music system is also one of the most premium feature with 8 speaker sound system.
Tata;Tigor20172020;8 Jan 2019;Prabagar Cap..;4.3; Daily Commute ;Tata Tigor is an excellent good looking car with good mileage at this price segment. The car has all the nextgen features with in built Harman kardon speakers (8 Nos) which makes this car the best for this price comparing the other cars in the market. When performance comes into picture, it feels heavy and pickup is that good enough since it has the 3 cylinder model. After all, Tata tigor is one o f the best product from TATA and it worth every single penny that you spent.
Tata;Tigor20172020;29 Feb 2020;Abhijeet Hinge;4.0; Family Car ;When bought in 2018 it was the best value for money car that time with the amount of features that comes in. The city mileage is around 12 to 13kmpl ,whereas on highway it gives minimum of 18 kmpl.
Tata;Tigor20172020;25 Nov 2020;Suresh Valuva;5.0; Family Car ;The best in class performance and features are provided by tata at convenient price.Who likes drive, Seating and music.And any.Can never afford to forgo this cute sedan.Ofcourse stylish too.
Tata;Tigor20172020;19 Dec 2018;Umesh Verma;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;I own XZA variant, that is amt in top avatar. It's awesomely convenient, feels much more safer once inside.For those who thinks amt's are not exciting you also get a Sport mode that will surprise you even if you are cruising at 100kph. It's a lovely car with beautiful sound system. The only thing I miss is electronically foldable ORVMs
Tata;Tigor20172020;28 Nov 2020;Laxmi Narayana;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Excellent sedan at that price range go for it, mileage city -15 , highway-19 , suspension is very good, amt is on bit slow pickup intially but it's not a big problem
Tata;Tigor20172020;20 Apr 2019;Dinesh Kumawat;4.0; Family Car ;Comfort and built quality is superb. Low cost of the car. Most disappointed point is that we can hear engine noise in cabin so easily despite it is a petrol car. But it is 1-2 lakh rupees cheap than top model of Amaze and Dzire. Average in highway is mind blowing above 20 but in city it delivers around 14-15.
Tata;Tigor20172020;17 Jul 2019;Rohit Patil;4.3; Occasional Commute ;Overall a great car, bang for the buck kind of value for money. Could definitely do with a bigger engine and more power. And tata should work on the nvh level for sure. Other than that no issues at all. 100% recommended for a long test drive before buying other car in this price range.
