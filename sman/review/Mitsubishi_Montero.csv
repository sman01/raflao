Mitsubishi;Montero;10 Oct 2020;Jayant Nyol;3.7; Family Car | Daily Commute ;Performance is excellent!! From Safety point of view I can say it’s best. This vehicle is not so comfortable and luxurious, but you get tough suspension and service cost is all not too much. It’s around 23 k after 10000kms. This vehicle is very rugged.
