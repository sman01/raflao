Ford;Figo;12 Apr 2019;Milw Aukee;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Model 2013; Figo Titanium 1.4 litre DuraTorq Diesel. Clocked 75K kms till date.Car is pretty robustly built and is reasonably engaging to drive. And there ends the good things about the car.After-sales services are the worst with Ford. Spare parts are extremely expensive and service centers have damaged my car multiple times when given for periodic maintenance !! E.g., once they broke the rear lef t side ABS sensor. Another time they broke the plastic cowl beside front bonnet. Another time, they broke the hood latch handle (plastic). Yet another time, they screwed up the ECU (after some update) that, while driving back from service center, the car went into limp mode. Another time they screwed up the wheel alignment (after suspension replacement). Once they misplaced the carpet and till date never bothered to give me a replacement or pay me money! Once they painted the front left fender and it had a massive over spray!Once I was overcharged by 1800 Rupees and settled that during another visit to same service center 2yrs later!!Mind you, all of these were from different Ford service centers across South India. Not a single one gave me a 10/10 service in the first attempt.
Ford;Figo;18 Jan 2021;Ramraj J;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Overall i like my car as this was my first new car, After 7.5 yrs(67, 000 kms) still feel like new car when car comes back from service no vibrations or no worn out feel inside the car, Very good sound system, Mileage is ok i am getting 15km in city for my style of driving, This was the vehicle which comes with full packed features for less cost in that segment when i bought, Some cons are there y ou will feel lag in highway when you suddenly applies break, Poor ground clearance, Ford service is good but you wont get bills very cheaper as they mention in tv adds i have all 7yrs service bills.
Ford;Figo;6 Dec 2019;Arun Kshirsagar;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I bought the Ford Figo 3 years back and it still seems to be as good as new. Maintenance costs are reasonable and to say the actual quality of the car itself is very strong and sturdy so need not worry about the safety.For the mileage part, I receive almost around 23 kmpl on highways and around 18.5 kmpl on mixed day to day commutes.The styling is something I am in love with but wish I could have some projector headlamps and DRLs to go with it.A bit sad about the lack of accessories available from the company and 3rd party vendors. Doesn't seem much popular among them.
Ford;Figo;9 Dec 2020;Suraj Nanda;4.7; Family Car ;I call it a budget rocket.Figo 1.5 is the best car in all aspects.Best in the class engine, Superb mileage 22-24kmph with ac on.Very low maintenance and first-class ford service.Powerful and frugal.Best handling in the segment.A strong body ensures a safety turbocharged engine.Awesome interiors and an awesome audio system.Worth every penny you spend on it.Cons: to improve: seat split, Boot space, Alloy for a spare tire, Digital display, Android auto, Little more ground clearance.
Ford;Figo;15 May 2020;Surya Sandeep;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Very practical car.....it's like planted to the road..... even at 150 speed you don't feel any vibrations......thought of changing of car, but there is no such car available. Figo deserves 5 Star ratingaround 3500 is the yearly maintenance (regular servicing).... My scooter (hero pleasure) costs me around 6000 maintenance per year and it gives a max of 20-25 kmpl..... Compared to scooters nowadays car maintenance is very easy
Ford;Figo;17 May 2020;Sai GouthamK..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The best hatchback of India but the most underrated one even. Handling is way ahead of all cars in this segment even mileage is decent with the low maintenance cost what it lacks is ground clearance which is very important for Indian roads but the second Gen Figo has got good ground clearance. Overall I have a very good experience with this car I drove 60k till now I haven't faced any major issues till now
Ford;Figo;28 Aug 2020;Haja Mohideen;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;One of a best car from ford, peppy engine and excellent driving dynamics. Dealership services is not so good. Do not buy extend warranty. The car doesn't have any flaws it'll runs upto 100000kms with simple PMS maintenance. 50000kms so far no any original parts replaced. After factory warranty don't bring it to dealership service, just service somewhere trusted garage.
Ford;Figo;12 Apr 2020;Anshul singh;4.7; Occasional Commute ;A good car for city rides and a great car for highways. Mileage in the city is meager 11-12kmpl but on highways you may get around 15-18kmpl. Performance and safety wise it's better than the rest of the cars in the segment. Handling is great on high speed without any vibration. Feature loaded car with styling and looks. Overall a great package in the price segment.
Ford;Figo;3 Mar 2020;Bedanta Phukon;3.0; Daily Commute;Had one of my worst experience on service from OEM Customer Care. They often try to make us fool. At initial period, service quality was pathetic. Now there is a vast improvement in my local dealer Chakrapati Ford. Don't know about other dealer.Customer care response was pathatic in my case. I had to communicate with Top Management in loop to resolve the issue.
Ford;Figo;22 Jun 2020;Rahul Dharmani;4.7; Family Car ;When it comes to a stylish , comfortable & a family category car the ford figo is one of the best in hatchbacks segment in India.If I say about the durability I'll give 10 out of 7 because I'm stating with a practical experience. Mileage is 11/12 I think that is not very poor .Overall it has been a very good & amazing family car of 5 people very comfortably.

The looks and sounds is amazing .. supension is superb you cant imagine with a hatch back car you are feeling safe and secure .. Little bit ground clearance should improve for indian village roads ... its a nice choice for me i am satisfied a lot with the overall performance .
Ford;Figo;24 Sep 2020;ANAND PANDEY;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Very comfortable riding if you ride b/w 90-110km/hrs.You will feel high punching j**k (pick up) in every gear. mileage on highway with full AC is 15km/ltr and without AC 17.5km/ltrOnly one drawback is ground clearance which makes you sometimes feel angry rest all ok. Its a great car in this price range
Ford;Figo;30 Oct 2020;Kalyanaboosh..;4.3; Daily Commute ;My figo 2020 bs6 provide good mileage in city trafic to 14.5-15 km/l.The performance is overall good.I reached the top speed to 140 kmph.Driver seat is little uncomfy for long travel.The wheelbase is good for a hatchback give a stable travel while on high speed and on sharp turn.
Ford;Figo;22 Mar 2020;Nisshant Rao;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Amazing car.

Ford;Figo;4 Dec 2019;Abhishek Rana;4.3; Family Car ;In Driving, I would say car is far better than it's competitors. When on the road, you will feel that you are driving a heavy vehicle which loves the road. Build quality is good, top notch with TATA. A biker hit my car from left side and astonishingly, no dent, no scratch what else you can expect in terms of safety. As of now, I got only 18KMPL of average on highways and 14.5 KMPL in city but who cares it when you are certain that you are in a good build car. Life is more precious than average specially with family.Ford has enhanced the car in terms of look and inside it feels premium. Every car has pros and cons so it has. But, I like the car and I feel safe inside it and nothing else matter to me except life.
