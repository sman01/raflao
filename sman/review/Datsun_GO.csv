Datsun;GO;31 Oct 2018;Vivek Mishra;5.0; Family Car ;Datsun Go facelift is probably the most sporty looking hatch back!Almost as heavy as swift with a peppy 1.2 ltr engine and the kerb weight as well!Orange color + the alloy wheels add to the charm!Pick better than swift! Only issue is that the Revs are bound till 5000 sp it runs out of breath post 125! But it belongs to a segment of small hatch a and is the best for city driving!
