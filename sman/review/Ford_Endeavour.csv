Ford;Endeavour;31 Aug 2020;Shubham Thakur;5.0; Family Car ;This is one hell of a vehicle. It is far better than Toyota Fortuner (which is overpriced) in every aspect, be it performance, comfort, refinement, feature and off-road abilities. Only thing I hate is by giving it a 2.0 Litre engine, Ford has taken away the bragging rights it had with the older much powerful 3.2 Litre engine. Great highway runner and easy to ride in the city as well. It is worth e very penny Ford asks for it.
Ford;Endeavour;25 Jul 2020;Jaswinder Singh;4.3; Tours ;I am having 4x4 Thunder Plus model. As it is used for only long tours, I am very happy with this vehicle. It is a peace of mind vehicle as you never have to worry about going to a new place regarding condition of roads or no roads. I drove it to worst of the places and experienced even a loose screw. It is still all original except battery and tyres.
