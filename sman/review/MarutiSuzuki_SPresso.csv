MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;9 Dec 2020;Abhishek Jain;4.7; Family Car ;I purchased s-presso in sep 2020, I found this car is safe and performance wise amazing in this price segment.Even though the global ncap is having the 0 star rating but vxi+ model has been tested, The ratings might have different figure.I have driven s-presso inside city and long trips i must say this is actually a breeze when you drive.You get amazing view from driver seat, Better head space for driver & rear passenger seats make the experience even better.Amt is one area where the improvements are required.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;20 Jan 2020;Sanjeev Chak..;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car;I bought S Presso Vxi (O) on 16.01.2020 from Prem sona Motors, Karke Road, Ranchi. To my astonishment I discovered later on that when you imply back gear, the lights provided in the tail light only has a provision of bulb on the left back side, while there is no provision of bulb on the right back side. When enquired about the same, the representative told me that the vehicle has provision of only one bulb on left back ride when you back your car. The logic is not explained.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;24 Dec 2020;Ray Michell;1.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;I own an spresso top model, It's an empty box.Windows are too high, Air don't enter.Frontal windows are remotely controlled, Back 2 windows are old fashioned.No rear glass wiper.Very tiny back side glass.Seats are not comfy.No mud guard in rear wheels.While driving and resting hand on window gives the feeling of driving a tempo because window is higher than any other cars.Ceiling is very light.Inc omplete maruti enfotainment service unlike swift top model.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;19 Jan 2020;Selva Ganesh;4.7; Occasional Commute;I bought s presso vxi plus last month....at that time I don't know to drive any car. But, this will help me to drive easily and quickly...due to front pallet view......and also there is no vibration and over sound from engine and surrounding......air conditioner is superb....car front look is superb...side and rear just ok .......boot space superb.....overall this car is perfect choice for city ri de and rural roads......
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;10 Jul 2020;Manish Kumar;3.3; Daily Commute ;Due to shorter width of vehicle, turning in speed is too much dangerous. Another thing is that too much noise inside the cabin, no power window in rear & alloy wheels even in top end variants. One more thing is no Fog light is available in top end variants which creates a problem during winter season, not even they give space to fit it from outsides.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;14 Apr 2020;NAVEEN P;2.3; Occasional Commute;looking like suv but outer look is not that much good and back seating also some what difficult especially in long drives it is good in city traffic perfectly suit for tall persons mileage also gives around 16-17 per liter but price is high,on this criteria people are not ready to buy

MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;9 Aug 2020;Pranav Jha;3.3; Family Car;guys the build quality of this car is very bad and in highway it will fly because of its low weight i will recommend you not to go for Maruti cars you will really regret . go for tata ,ford,etc there built quality is good and the price is also decent .
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;20 Mar 2020;Shashank Singh;4.3; Family Car;this is my favourite car in my collection. this is the cheapest and best mileage car under 5 lakhs. it has a touch screen and airbags. only one issue is that it has only front power window. except this it is the best car for those who are in low budget.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;24 Sep 2020;Raj Godara;1.7; Family Car;it's No All power window in this car..only front window. second No Allow wheels in this car. third No Mobile Charging point in this car. fourth No Arm rest in this car In front and rear seat. and No advance feature in this car. very costly car.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;18 Jul 2020;Nalina Kumar;2.7; Daily Commute ;Mileage is okay. As a small and low price vehicle, it is good. But the comforts of the driving is fantastic. Same time Maruti gave only one reverse light in the back, it was too bad what they did. If I know before this, I will not buy the vehicle
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;19 Jan 2020;Manikanta SV;2.3; Family Car;I bought top end vxi plus, from day two I am experiencing lot of noise from engine side, I am not feeling the vehicle is petrol engine. In order to avoid noise, we need to drive vehicle with music ON. Also interior quality is poor.
MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;14 Jun 2020;;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I have had a very good driving experience so far. Just completed 2000km. Amazing for long drives.

MarutiSuzuki;SPresso;23 Jul 2020;Naidu;1.7; Daily Commute ;Accessories are costly. Drl price is 10K morethan headlights cost. company not producting ZXI. So company wheels are scarp if you want alloy wheels. You can't contact maruti. you can contact only dealers.
