Mahindra;Marazzo;24 Dec 2018;Anjan J;5.0; Tours | Family Car ;After lots of speculation and apprehension finally we bought our 2nd family car, A marazzo M8. After driving 1000 km in the first week ; now i share my view on this car. My requirement was a 7 seater good car in a decent price . Innova is good, but was out of budget for me. I had to decide among Ertiga, Lodgy, marazzo, BRV and lower variant of Hexa. Marazzo was chosen after a lot of R & R . It pro ved to be Superb sedan comfort in a MPV at a reasonable price. The ride quality is really very good. Driving is superb , easy steering, light pedals,easy visibility. Gear Transmission is smooth and braking response is very gently precise. I did not have to worry for the path holes or speed breaker , because suspension is the best in class I have ever driven.Regarding engine power: it generated so much power that it glided my fully loaded(7 adults) ahead of crystas ,XUV 500 etc on the highway. Look is definitely a personal choice. But with practicability of cornering lights,infotainment screen, good supporting seats... I will say Marazzo gave me the best value of my hard earn money.I am impressed with this crafted piece of good automobile engineering.Experience after 8 months(19000km): my experience and view remains same about Marazzo. Each time I drive this car , m actually impressed with the responsiveness of this car. After completing many family outings with this companion, I can say that I purchased a great value car.
Mahindra;Marazzo;11 Aug 2020;Soham Kulkarni;5.0; Family Car ;It's a great and one of the most refined car by Mahindra, as it have many luxurious features and material quality in a good value as compare to others.. Marazzo have developed on ladder framework, It also looks much bigger, more muscular, more stylish, more powerful and the mpv promising features which are also beautifully packed in this car such as It is more specious, comfortable and fuel effici ent car...I think its a best car between ertiga and innova which has both mpv as well as suv features which makes it excellent package by Mahindra

Mahindra;Marazzo;15 Aug 2020;Deepak Thakur;4.3; Tours | Family Car ;Best family car in this price and more spacious than Innova crysta . The mileage is 17kmpl on highway and 13kmpl in hilly areas. The things which should be improve , Ground clearance is good from the middle and back but ground clearance is too low from the front side . The front bumper hits very easily on small bumps .Engine is not so powerful ,at least 2000cc should be given
Mahindra;Marazzo;12 Mar 2019;Imdad Ahmed;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Marazzo is a beautifully crafted car keeping in mind the quality of ride for the passengers .The ride quality is too good and as far the cabin noise is considered its far better than petrol cars. Having a diesel engine under its hood and having a quite cabin is a perfectly match of refined engine and good insulation..On the mileage front without AC with an average speed of 70Km-80km one can easily churn out 20KM/L whereas with full AC on one can easily get between 18 -18.5 KM/L. In city the mileage drops to a decent 16Km/l to 17km/l with AC. In a whole Mahindra Marazzo is an excellent package of features bundled together. After a long time mahindra has put a perfectly balanced MPV in the market
Mahindra;Marazzo;22 Oct 2020;Anoop Anilkumar;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car;this car is the best thing that has happened to me the mileage of the car is phenomenal I get close to 16 plus no matter how I drive the last long drive I did was to Goa from Cochin and the comfort was awesome no one in my family felt any fatigue I was the only driver and I enjoyed every bit of the ride. a very happy customer indeed.
