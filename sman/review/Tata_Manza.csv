Tata;Manza;4 Nov 2019;Aditya On;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;Tata Manza Aura Abs bought back in 2011, was the car I loved to drive. The car was really spacious and its rear seat was none less than a Sofa. The car was too much comfortable. The driving was enough comfortable for long 1000kms runs. The power the car deliver @ First Gear was just awesome. I love Manza for its spacious cabin, exterior design, and the memories I had with the car.
Tata;Manza;20 Aug 2018;Sumit Dnyanesh;2.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Strong engine but body build is not good. Average is better for initial 50k kms but after that avg goes down and parts starts asking for replacement like clutch, gear cable, axle n link rod, alternator belt and timing chainkit, steering pump and oil pressure pump etc. Size is awesome and best for ling journey. Tyres and suspension are at par. Service centers are not up to the mark.
