Hyundai;i10;25 Sep 2019;Saurabh Singhal;4.7; Daily Commute ;I have been using Hyundai i10 1.2 Kappa Automatic Transmission (2009) and have already driven it for more than 75,000 kms so far. The car has never given me a reason to worry and was a feature-rich, affordable AT hatchback at the time of purchase. It is full-time AT with creep function and very much unlike jugaad AMTs of present times.
