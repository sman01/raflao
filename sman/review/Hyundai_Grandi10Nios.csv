Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;10 Aug 2020;PRAFFUL V;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I have used it for almost a month now and it has been a satisfactory purchase. Rear seats are inclined and some people especially elderly ladies might not feel comfortable(it might be only my mom too), but ride quality is great. super highway performance. in lower gears you can feel gear switch. as the car crossed 3rd gear then you will hardly feel any gear shifts. i am a novice driver and i am co mfortable in riding. its my first car, so i cant compare with any other one's. no complaints from now with respect to build quality as its Hyundai its amazing.internals feel great, hassle free ride in bangalore. and believe me when i say, Sill board is one such junction which is nightmare for any driver, but in heavy traffic too, i hardly felt any problems, considering i only need to apply break occasionally.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;16 Nov 2019;Vamsee Mohan;4.0; Occasional Commute ;I bought my NIOS in september already drive 2500+km max in highway. Its engine smoothness and sound quality is better than normal grand i10. I like dash board design. Its being ready BS VI its claimes almost 19 to 20kmpl on highway. In city its approx 15. I am forget to share my car model. Its Asta petrol. Feeling comfort and also feeling comfort in driving on long drives.Cons:-1. I am feeling a b it of lag while climbing hills like i went to Tirumala, Tirupathi2. Default Navigation is not provided by Hyundai we use them only with Android auto or Apple. If we have basic mobile its impossible of Navigation.3. Expensive. Its approx ORP is 8.7L.My overall rating is 3.5/5
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;5 Jul 2020;Dushyant Sri..;4.7; Family Car ;At this price point, Hyundai is offering a lot. Seat comfort, upmarket cabin, space in cabin, decent boot space. Comparing this car with swift(Just because 99% of Indian's know swift pretty well) Cabin looks more premium, Plastic quality is way better than swift and most importantly the build quality is better than swift but don't forget swift wins the battle in Average fuel consumption.In my opin ion fixed headrest is a downside of this car, which was not a deal break for me else everything is great.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;21 Jun 2020;Rajesh Reang;4.3; Occasional Commute;its my first time car..i used most of the time in rural road 90% hilly area ... in hilly area with 2nd gear is the best things to climb no matter how high it is... those who said getting lag may b those using 4 or 5th gear in uphill those are nonsense ..there is no lag unless you used ac .. highway also good and drive like 65 to 70kmph again those who said powerless on highway are those nonsense s quid whio wana drive at 200kmph speed then go get Lamborghini..
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;14 Dec 2020;Gaurav Taneja;1.0; Daily Commute ;Same problem with me.I bought in september end.October chali and november se problem aa rahi hai.I have to drive at least more than 6-8 km on petrol otherwise, Car switch off on cng.Earlier vibrations on cng mode were also coming.Service center people don't know what to do.They ask to wait for software update but to no avail.Can i return and get my money back? if possible please help me.First car, Very much depressed because of this issue.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;1 Jul 2020;Deepak Mohan;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;As a owner, I felt it was a best choice buying brand new Hyundai i10 grand nios because it has more leg room at the rear passenger seat, good looking interior, it as more features than the other cars in this segment, engine is quiet refined and smooth. It has exciting features like wireless charging first in the segment, rear AC vents and many more. It is also the best city car and stable in highw ays.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;5 Feb 2020;Santosh Kumar;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Considering the features it's worth every penny spent, however after driving it for 6000 KMs, i can see some boot noise peeping through the cabin. However the MVH levels are well contained. May be because of the pathetic traffic I am not able churn our the best mileage. I am getting around 13 in the Hyderabad traffic.I don't regret considering this on Tiago.
Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;25 Oct 2020;Deepak Sethi;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Except rear seat, rest of car is really good. I like its performance. The only issue is that rear seat is not much comfortable. Person seating on rear seat feels bumping even on smooth road. One star cut for that. Both front seats are very comfortable. Pickup is very good. Automatic climate control works well. Infotainment consol is user friendly.

Hyundai;Grandi10Nios;18 Jan 2021;Parthasarath..;3.7; Family Car ;Though the model has good features but, It is missing a very important thing like, No glow signs at the driver's door for operating the functions at night.This is ridiculous.
