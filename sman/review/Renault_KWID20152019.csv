Renault;KWID20152019;29 Mar 2019;Suvin Kumar;1.0; Daily Commute ;Iam a recent buyer of Renault Kwid AMT and bought it to gift my wife.All the booking were done as we were convinced of the service and effort taken.But on 25th March 2019(delivery date) things changed really bad when I arrived to get the delivery of my car-1) As I was waiting in the longe finishing the formalities ,I noticed a staff showing our car like a demo car to a new customers. The customer" s kids got in the car and spoiled the interior . When asked on the situation , they said its normal. I demanded that I get my car cleaned again for which they had done a very shabby job.-2) I got into my car to check the features, I found out that the Apple car play and Android auto that was promised to us is not available in the model given to us, where as Ms Radhika your sales associates promised it to us not once but more than twice. Again all they had to say is sorry.With much reluctance and unhappiness we took he delivery of the car.-3) Once delivered, on road we found out that the light inside the car was not working & infact had a lose contact. We bought the car back to the showroom to rectify it and to get the fast tag sticker done which they apparently forgot and I had to ask them.They said they rectified the light but the same issue continued post the correction. I have a video as proof taken to show the showroom, but as usual everyone was too busy to attend to our inconvenience . There is also a complaint in the meter console as inspite of putting petrol worth 2000 rs , the milage and indication of petrol dropped to almost empty within less than 10km of drive. Milage shown was 7km/l. On complaining all these, they promised to pick up the car from our house to rectify it, but even now the pickup has not been done . And they are forcing us to register the car, Why should we?This is not our first car and we own other brand as well. But we are highly disappointed at what happening and really sad that they have no care attitude towards us.-The customer service at the TVS & Sons, Renault Maradu,Kerala is beyond bad and never expected this before buying ,- We expected Renault to keep up a standard-Promise are done from the sales consultant to the sales managers. Why promise and commit when you cannot keep it?- It is our money and emotions involved. Is the service only till the car is booked by giving false promises?-Past sales we don"t even have human consideration.Never expected this from a brand like Renault.Waiting for at least a positive response from the customer service teamWith much regret
Renault;KWID20152019;11 Aug 2019;Neha Arora;1.0; Daily Commute ;Its a pathetic car and worst service people also. I recently bought this car. As its my first car i thought i should buy new one because i don't want to face any problem which usually happened with second hand car on a regular basis so i took the decision to buy a new one but in 4 months i visited the service 5 times for repairing my new car. It doesnt matter it is in warrenty because for me my ti me is very pricious and why should i have invested in new car if this kind of problem is happening, again and again, it is still not repaired yet. From the first month AC problem, average issue and automatic stop on highway issue happened. Today again someone picked for AC repair and again they said it will take 5days to correct the issue. Its height now they gave me a defective car and they have to replace it now otherwise I will take legal action against them its my hard earn money and i will not accept this defective car. same service centre people are not able to fix it till yet how i can believe again and what about my time my patience
Renault;KWID20152019;12 Dec 2020;KINSHUK SARA..;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Good looks, had tonnes of features and descent for a first time driver. Gave really good mileage of 17-20kmpl in city traffic conditions. Not too comfortable to sit, ride quality is not great and driving couldve been better. At the same time, very pratical, lots of storage space & bottle holders. As accessories you can convert rear seats to power window.Its a pure city car and is not suited for hi ghway driving, I'm satisfied with the car as it serves my needs.

Renault;KWID20152019;21 Jul 2019;NH42 Auto;3.3; Occasional Commute;First of all, Kwid is all about budget and mileage oriented vehicle.Do not expect for safety and performance and make sure you will be using it for city use as it is designed for city conditions.Pros:Mileage.Comfort within speed limit of 100kmph.Less maintenance.Touchscreen navigation with Bluetooth connectivity.Bootspace.Body design.AC.Cons:Gage is not good.(Even touched with stone or pressed har d, chances of getting dent and damage is more)No Safety,Which must be prioritized.No rear power windows.No rear speakers.No mirror adjustment knobs from inside.Comfortable only for 4 people.Wheel is having just 3 bolts, but entry level hatch back like eon, Alto has 4.Suggestion is, if you are a single driver, in need for daily commute or a small family for use within city limits,this will be the best at this price segment and features.As a owner for almost 3 yrs,these are my experience.Think wise and choose.
