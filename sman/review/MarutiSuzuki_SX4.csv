MarutiSuzuki;SX4;31 Oct 2020;Dhayaalan VR;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;Sx4 is the most underrated car of the last decade, Just like this decade fiat cars.It sports a 1586cc, 103.2bhp, Independent suspension, Abs disk breaks, Leather seats, Very high ground clearance and everything at just 7.47 lakhs unlike any other car of that time.It was the most luxurious yet a very affordable car that any middle class man might expect.Even the car of the year 2007 honda civic tho ugh had higher performance ratings didn't meet up with its comfort standards and suspension technology.It was always regarded as a failure model, But in our family it had been with us for 13 years now and its still gold, Except for the mileage which any car with over 200000 km travel would have ended up with.
MarutiSuzuki;SX4;7 Nov 2020;Manav Sharma;4.7; Daily Commute ;Sx4 is great in mileage if you running it in sequential fitted cng.As in comfort this is the best car in its older times.Even today also n performance you will get to know if you can catch me on delhi jaipur highway.Even new variant of verna can't beat the sx4 speed.
