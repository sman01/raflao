Hyundai;Venue;5 Jan 2020;Kunal Choksi;2.0; Daily Commute;Purchased this car in July 2019 i.e. the DCT automatic 1.0 turbo petrol S model Review after 6 month use A. Hyundai india and modi hyundai never informed the consumers that DCT will overheat in bumper to bumper taffic during the pre sales and sales cycle B. Overheating is mentioned in the car owner manual which during sales cycle no one shows to the potential customer C. If you reverse and drive t he car a couple of times during parking the temp will go up D. The car overheats in bumper to bumper traffic and you will have to stop the carE. If you have to drive, then you will keep switching between neutral and drive mode whenever you stop this defeating the purpose of buying an automatic F. Lost complete faith and kick my self in buying a hyundai car DO NOT BUY THE HYUNDAI VENUE DCT VERSION IF YOU HAVE TRAFFIC IN YOUR AREA
Hyundai;Venue;22 Sep 2020;Anurag Gupta;5.0; Daily Commute ;Value for money with excellent performance. Highway mileage is very negotiable, you can extract 18-20 kmpl on highways at speed of 80-100 kmph in 6th gear.Even while throttling it hard at 140 kmph you get mileage of about 14-15 kmpl.City mileage depends on traffic conditions and getting 13-15 kmpl is not a big deal.Drivability is another plus factor with this car, it gives you a good driving exper ience. (I have driven it for about 5400 km in just 2 months which includes 2 trips from Aligarh to Sonbhadra in UP)P.S - highway mileage calculated thrice on 320 km long Lko-Agra expressway, also regularly cross checked on NH 34 from Aligarh to Khurja.
Hyundai;Venue;21 Aug 2020;Anoop Damodaran;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;zigwheels brought me the first intimation of venue s+ variant launched..otherwise i was planned to purchase the s variant of venue and booked the vehicle on July 8 2020, decided to make fitments aftermarket, zigwheels in time notified the introduction of venue s+ variant in which all the equipments came factory fitted on a low price of after market and in which automatic head lamps, height adjusta ble seats, drvm etc is not possible in aftermarket. thank you cardekho team for such a timely response loved it
Hyundai;Venue;30 Oct 2019;Ravi Shanker;2.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;The car is amazing in all aspect except one that its DCT transmission has got overheating issues when driven in extreme traffic conditions.Secondly there is no proper customer care support as they say that driving the car in extreme traffic conditions is considered as harsh driving and one must avoid it.I wonder how Hyundai can be so casual in addressing the customers concern.My advice would be st ay away from DCT as this does not seem to be made for Indian traffic conditions
Hyundai;Venue;28 Jun 2020;Kohli Sahej;4.3; Daily Commute;I have been using the turbo petrol manual sx variant for my daily commute. It is a car that’ll give you a fun to drive experience.It reaches 120km/h in its 3rd gear and acceleration is brisk ( 0-100 in somewhere around 10.5 seconds ).Suspension set up of this car could have been better. And the rear profile of the car could have been better. It gives me a mileage of around 15-16 kmpl.This includ es occasional heavy acceleration.
Hyundai;Venue;13 Sep 2020;Bilal Ali;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Overall a good car in the package keeping the budget in mind. Hyundai has always been at the core front of delivering a quality driving experience & loaded features. The Turbo petrol is really fun to drive, if you are a small family then go for it without a toss. The suspension area is something which the car makers have to seriously work in, it's pathetic. Overall a good budget car!
Hyundai;Venue;20 Aug 2020;Kamal Agarwal;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Shock absorbers are not upto the mark, one side rear tyres lift up while turning and driving hill simultaneously at a time. Very very very sensible vehicle in terms of mileage, mileage is good if you constantly running and changing gears smoothly, but if you are abit rough in changing gears or using clutch than mileage drops suddenly, i have personally tested and calibrated.
Hyundai;Venue;29 Sep 2020;Vimal Singh;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Its the pleasure to drive city ride with optimum space and comfort and yet the supportive power. The b st part of this car is its 1. Crome grill and 2. The steering wheel. The electric steeering wheel is the key game changer for both of the sister concern car manufacturers be it KIA MOTORS or HYUNDAI MOTORS. Its amazing!
Hyundai;Venue;14 Sep 2020;Bhargav Reddy;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;mileage is horrible for me. For petrol version i am getting around 11-12 kmpl .and comfort if the road is good then there is no problem but if there are any p*t holes then people sitting back will experience hell. All remaining are fine and up ti the mark. Think and look for multiple options before choosing.
Hyundai;Venue;5 Sep 2020;Mhon Ngullie;3.3; Daily Commute ;Poor suspension quality. Driven only 6500 km. Got replaced front & rear shock absorber, steering rack, rear coil spring. Steering column going to be replaced. Still suspension noise is there. Driving comfort is zero in bad road condition. Very disappointed becoz of suspension problems.
Hyundai;Venue;14 Sep 2020;Amit Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;This is the car i was much awaiting for and i have driven this car for 4000km and it is so smooth tough and makes you feel safe at high speed and also it has great control. Styling and all is standard in this variant it only lacks in the sitting comfort a bit but that can be managed.
Hyundai;Venue;24 Oct 2020;Rajesh Ayyappan;5.0; Family Car ;It's a very good car for a small family with a max of 4 members and showing much comfort while driving. Though it's 1-liter turbo sometimes I felt the pickup is somewhat needed more. Maybe because while comparing with 1.5 liters which prior to that I used to drive.
Hyundai;Venue;1 Sep 2019;Updates Global;1.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Don't buy this car. At lease don't prefer the turbo engine.
Hyundai;Venue;18 Mar 2020;Mohammed Faris;3.7; Family Car ;This is best one but mileage is very low. features,styling ,comfort ,safety and performing is very high . I like suv cars Best car I've ever seen.The smallest car is the XVV segment that can be taken very quickly on any small road
Hyundai;Venue;22 Jan 2021;Shivam Dhiman;4.0; Daily Commute ;Superb performance with simple and cool interior design.External design is awesome.I love the cornering lights.However the gear changing is bit jerky and also travel is much if compared to maruti cars.But overall the car is good.
Hyundai;Venue;7 Mar 2020;Rachita Pati;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;I think the designer should focus on interior design of the car as well . The interiors are very basic and doesn't give a luxurious feel at all. overall performance of the car and exterior is great .Very smooth drive .
Hyundai;Venue;12 Mar 2020;Siddhartha Das;3.7; Daily Commute ;I bought 1.2 s model petrol.. could not manage 1.4 Diesel s model as out of stock bs4_6 issues,it's Abit underpowered in lower gears. Shaking is so so .. other facilities are good enough.
Hyundai;Venue;4 Sep 2020;Aman Rastogi;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;One of the best compact SUV in the market, which doesn't miss out on any feature you need.Though upcoming cars (Sonet) has a bit edge over venue, still venue is just at Sonet's tail.
Hyundai;Venue;18 Aug 2020;Mohit Sharma;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Poor matrial used for decreasing cost.Two times tyre have burst.15 inches spare wheel.front glass broke just with a small stone who flew from front vechile.less leg space in rear seat
Hyundai;Venue;6 Dec 2020;Vinay S;3.7; Family Car ;Nice car but some safety features are missing which i get if i buy ford ecosport.But i likr mileage of this car if i drive normally means under 90 them i definitely get 24 25 mileage.
Hyundai;Venue;16 Mar 2020;Kevin Toppo;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;it has just been about a month with the car and I'm already enjoying the potential the car gives, I'm just eagerly waiting to clock miles and miles in this car. Way to go Hyundai!

Hyundai;Venue;26 Oct 2020;Ajay Bahlani;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;It is a nice Family car . Love the features and smooth driving. Good grip on road as well. It has cruize option which make the driving more comfortable.
Hyundai;Venue;31 Jul 2020;Dayanand Gan..;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Good car for the budget, could have been better with little more safety features like hill assist control and traction control, as in Nexon base variant.
Hyundai;Venue;28 Jul 2019;Arpit Arora;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I bought this car in june and since then it's performance was awesome until the car got fully packed and there1was constant noise from the back seat of the car every time i passed through a pothole. Is this issue with others also? I am keeping psi at 37 in all tyres. Thanks.
