MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;16 Feb 2020;Vijay Kumar;4.0; Family Car;Owning/Driving Ignis Zeta MT from last 14 months, crossed 9500 kms on odometer till now. My buying experience:As I had already owned secondhand Maruti 800cc and driven Alto K10 (1000 cc) cars in the past & now wish to buy a new car for the first time, I was looking for a 1200cc car, within budget of 6.5 lakhs, so shortlisted Swift, New Hyundai Santro, Tata Tiago and Ignis. Took test drive of each of them. Facelift Swift VXI was overall a good car but costing at around 7.06 lakhs OTR, Santro Asta test drive was not satisfactory. Tata Tiago XZ was at 6.30 lakhs OTR but had 3 cylinder engine.Further I found that Maruti Swift, Baleno, Dezire & Ignis have the same K12B petrol engine generating similar power.Due to heavy year-end discounts the Ignis Zeta MT was costing me at 6.39 lakhs OTR. In this price I was getting a 1200cc 4 cylinder engine car with 15 inch Alloy Wheels, Push Button Start, Body Cladding, Blue tooth & steering control enabled music system having 6 speakers, Fog lamps, Rear-defoggers with wash wipers, Auto folding ORVM, Extended warranty, NEXA Card & Fast tag. Unbeatable deal, So ignored all other options and finalised the Ignis.From test drive to delivery of the car, NEXA dealership have given me a very nice and memorable experience.Pros:Peppy driving.Standard safety features across all variants.Very good mileage, 14-15 in city & 20-22 on highways with AC on.High ground clearance.Sufficient head and leg room.Easy ingress and outgress.Low maintenance & service cost.Many small features in Ignis such as Door handle design, adjustable head rests on all seats, 60:40 foldable rear seat, Split tail light, bigger tyres, etc are found only in costlier and premium cars.Cons:Rear design of the car is very unique but not appealing to the masses and it is the sole reason behind low sales figures of the Ignis.Body panels are weaker compared to other cars as it easily get dents from hitting of small stones on the road.Somewhat stiff suspension.Servicing at regular Maruti Dealership, so no NEXA experience after purchase.My experience with the car:My routine driving is on poor roads. I have also taken a long road trip with family in my Ignis. But no problem at all.First 3 services within a year are free from Maruti. It costs me around 3600rs. for the oil change, wheel balancing alignment and minor spares till today.From my own experience I can say that Ignis is the Best car at this price point. I recommend to buy NEXA card, as the whole cost of the card can be redeemed within a year.Extended warranty is a gimmick and may be avoided.
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;18 Jan 2021;Gift Ajay;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;We selected this car as a family on 2017. I went by engine specifications, power output, ground clearance and drive dynamics. The wife and kid chose the color, a car small on the outside but large on the inside; while the father a previous Maruti Wagonr owner selected the model and the accessories. All this narrowed down to a bundle called the Ignis. Happy and feeling blessed with the Ignis.
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;12 Dec 2020;Persi Mistry;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car;It is smooth car ride but only sometimes v get jerk while realizing brake pedal on stop signal n pressing acellator. That time little jerk v observe but on the hold car is good for driving long distance going to up-country. Or shift in manual mode it climbs in 1st or 2nd gear for mountainous roads like Khandala, Lonavla, Mahad Ghats Road, Mahableshwar or Panchgani etc..
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;29 Dec 2018;MANJULA KARANAM;4.7; Family Car ;I AM RAMAGOPAL RAO VLN. DHONE TOWN KURNOOL DISTRICT. I BOUGHT IT ON 12TH DECEMBER 2018, IGNIS ALPA MT PETROL LIMITED EDITION CAR IT EXCELLENT AND SUPERB PETROL CAR. SINCE 2 YEARS I SCARCHED SEVERAL CARS , BUT NO ONE CAN BEAT IT. IT IS VERY EXCELLENT IN ALL ASPECTS. OF MILEAGE, GROUND CLEARANCE, HEIGHT,ENGINE SMOOTH. PICKUP, NAVIGATION, SMART PLY INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD IN THIS CAR. I DRIV E 750 KMS WITH THE SPEED OF 70 TO 80 KM PER HOURS. WITH THE CONTROL OF 2 RPM BY USING THE SPEED PETROL I GOT 23KMPL. IT IS VERY AMAZING . THANKS TO MARUTI SUZUKI.IT GOT 3 STAR RATING TO CRASH TEST OF NCAP AND 5 STAR RATING TO SAFETY TEST OF NCAP. I FOUND OUT IN MY SEARCH.SO I PURCHAED IN KURNOOL.
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;21 Sep 2020;Karan Sharma;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Iy has been 3 years since i got Ignis Alpha Top Model Manual. It is a good city car with best in class gear box and clutch. But if you are looking for a vehicle which is comfortable for long road trips than this one is not for you. In Bumby roads you can feel everything inside the cabin. And at the end of you travel tou will feel exhausted
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;1 Aug 2020;Tinu George;4.7; Family Car ;I had driven my maruti ignis about 10,000 km still it is giving me a wonderful feel of driving . And I'm also happy with the mileage . I'm glad to be a owner of ignis . One bad thing of the vehicle is it's back portion is looking a bit bad but if you are looking for an powerful hatchback I prefer IGNIS . It's best for FAMILY CAR
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;30 Jan 2020;Nikunj Sodha;5.0; Daily Commute ;I get 22 kmpl mileage on road. it is feature packed and powerful car. I have bought this car one and half month ago. driven 4000 kilometres. completely satisfied with power II mileage features and style as well. shock absorber nice and build quality are 90% satisfactory. thank you Maruti Suzuki and thankyou CarDekho.
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;22 Nov 2019;Vaibhav Asthana;4.7; Daily Commute;Ignis is very good car for city driving as well as Highway.Its Peppy design is very helpful for overtaking.Mileage is good in city also. Engine specifications are same as Swift hence engine is very refine. Ground clearence 180 mm helps in rough roads which is very important for indian roads.

MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;12 Oct 2020;Madhur Arora;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Great car in its price segment. High ground clearance make it better than grand i10 and other competitive models.Mileage around 16 km per litre in the city and 19 km per litre on the highway, and in winters without ac its more than 21 km per litre.
MarutiSuzuki;Ignis;4 Mar 2019;Manu Jose;4.0; Family Car ;Ignis is a compact car, but it is very much spacious in its segment. I would say its the perfect car for beginners. Easy to drive. I own a manual transmission petrol engine. Power delivery is smooth, engine doesn"t lags. Fun to drive , post 2500 rpm its flying. Sound damping is not so great. We can feel that when the car is moving through rough surface roads. But overall its great. Again one word perfect for beginners
