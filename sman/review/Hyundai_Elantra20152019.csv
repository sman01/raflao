Hyundai;Elantra20152019;20 Jul 2020;Rajiv Maniar;4.7; Daily Commute;I own the top end automatic version of Elantra 2016. It is a very refined vehicle and comfortable to drive and to be driven. I have driven 70000 km but the vehicle seems new and it has relatively low maintenance cost. Overall quite happy with Hyundai service as well.
Hyundai;Elantra20152019;20 Aug 2019;Antony Manjo..;4.3; Family Car ;Elantra is an excellent car, with lot of space in both rows, comfort and safety. Of course, the mileage is low. However, I purchased the car knowing the low mileage. So there is no room for any complaint!!!
