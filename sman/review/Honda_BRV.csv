Honda;BRV;16 Feb 2020;Gopikrishna ..;5.0; Family Car | Tours;I am using honda top end model for.about 6 months its pretty good in performance and comfortness. Mileage is also not tht less as compared to other cars now adays in the market. Mileage on highways is 16 as tested by ARAI and in city 11 to 12. Mixed route traffic mileage i hav touched 13 mileage. CVT engines most reliable and good for engine performance. I dpnt hav any complaints as far as honda v ehicle brv is concerned.one shud go fr brv if 7 seater is reqd. Does not look heavy as other 7 seaters look but ample of luggage space is also avalable
Honda;BRV;11 Jul 2020;Jaideep Chitnis;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Have owned many sedans, the BRV is a MPV, but the engine experience, the smoothness, the maneuverability s almost like a Civic or City sedan. Its been 4 years owning and driving more than 100,000 kms. Thoroughly satisfied. Although, must state that I had to spend almost a 1.5 lakh extra in beefing up the console with a Blsupunct, hsnds free, DLRs, Stanley leather seats and leather steering wheel , better headlights, Michelin tyres etc.I shall rate it overall better than the Hyundai Greta, which I also own.
Honda;BRV;18 Nov 2020;Dhruv Gautam;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Awesome combination of comfort+power. It gives a good mileage and have a powerful engine. If you want to go for touring then this is the best car. I bought it just few months ago and got a great response from honda dealership from which i was impressed. There is a best thing that after you buy a honda car then there is no need of worrying about seevice.Honda is best
Honda;BRV;3 Sep 2018;Israr Mohi;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Me and my family has enjoyed every bit of a second in a brv it's so easy to drive in city traffics, on highway it pulls and have more than adequate performance for car that big I have seen 0-100 kmh in 10.11 seconds on my car which is petrol vtec engine, got a touchscreen optional from the dealer and it works fine,1on long journeys about 1200 km or more were never a trouble for our family of 8, an d car does keeps pulling and to its top speed and you won"t even feel your pushing the car it so refined, and when we don"t push the car to hard and doesn"t hit the vtec we got 16.5 kml and sometimes 16.9 kml on a manual transmission that is more than what Honda has stated
Honda;BRV;13 Jun 2019;Saurabh Singhal;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I have been driving BR-V since July 2016 and have been in love with it ever since! A very practical and versatile car it is with zero body roll on hilly terrain and excellent ground clearance makes every ditch easy. I choose this over XUV500, Scorpio and Innova (previous generation) and am glad about my decision. It offers great space like a full-size SUV, while comfort of a midsize sedan. Fuel ef ficiency in Diesel is superb. Overall, a great buy which most Indians have not appreciated simply because of its long design, which in practical use, perhaps helps the car to remain stable.
Honda;BRV;24 Mar 2019;Balaji Viswa..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I would say this as my excellent choice with respect to family car, performance, safety and still stylish too. I drove my BRV (my kids call it as ditto) on or within 2K rpm and to my surprise in highway, it gave me 18+ Kmpl. On an avg, my highway drive is 16-17Kmpl. Have experienced good even fully loaded condition and as well single. I LOVE it.. I feel only stuff that could have made even more ri ch would be the addition of features (especially cruise control, auto rain wipe, dash board and infotainment with better features)..
Honda;BRV;26 May 2019;Desmond Desouza;5.0; Family Car ;Its been 3 Year I have this car and its simply amazing. Its versatile, I can use it as a 5 seater with more boot space and 7 seater when I need to accommodate more family members. Its soft on my pocket where it come to fuel economy and maintenance, Its stylish and sports a premium look. Its a Panther on the road, it gives the mush needed boost when accelerated. As I said its simply amazing a perfe ct family vehicle. Totally satisfied :)
