Datsun;rediGO;21 Jul 2020;Jashwant Sonara;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car;it seems, Datsun redi-go has a default problem of brake. It doesn't provide command and feel of control over vehicle when using its brakes. Reverse gear drive also not comfortable. boot opener given below driver seat, totally brainless. also, power windows buttons given under hand brake, Japanese car but no brain used here too designing the car. bought though, due to look and budget for automatic, just few Kms (10) drive a day and didn't know these lacking before buying. recommend not to buy, better alternative is celerio but probably 1lac+ more.
