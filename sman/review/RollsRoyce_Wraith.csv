RollsRoyce;Wraith;26 Dec 2019;Shunit Datta;4.3; Daily Commute;It's a very good car but the mileage is terrible. There weren't any service centers when I took this to Ladakh. It's also tough to maintain since when I used this as a school bus (I am a bus driver), all the kids start dirtying my beautiful matte carpets. This car is very overpriced. Get a Maruti Alto instead since it can seat 4 people and has good mileage
