HeroMotoCorp;SplendorPlus;21 Dec 2019;Harinder Amb..;4.6; Daily Commute ;I am using splendor plus since Feb 2004 same was replaced with new one splendor in may 2010 which am using till now. Here I'm sharing my experience with the same.It's very good bike for daily commuters. It's very low maintenance bike and good built quality.If you maintain & drive your bike as per owner manual so need not to major repair work except service for long last.Here is details of parts re placement of my bike just completed 100850 with Regular service at every 2000km...First chainset replaced at 30000km, Second at 58000 km & 3rd is at 92000km...Rear tyre once at 58000km and tube 2-3 times... Timing chain at 82000km...Front tyre not replaced yet only tube replaced once ...Visor & one indicator once.. Rear Brakes 4-5 times & coupling 2 times... front brakes 2 times... Clutch Cable, Breake cable once .So I would like to say thanks to #Hero Honda (now heromotocorp) for good build quality.
HeroMotoCorp;SplendorPlus;28 Jul 2020;Philips Anthony;3.4; Daily Commute ;Hero was change the brake system of hero splendor Plus drum brakes to disc brakes for improve stopping power, digital instrumental console for better information like trip meter, gear shift indicaton,abs and increase the rear tyre size to 100/90 to improve the girp while turning in curvy road, change the fuel tank cap for easy opening.change the lighting system halogen to led, harzad flasher when riding in rainy condition. So overall hero splendor Plus is a practical commute in city traffic and touring ,it is affordable bike for middle class family .
HeroMotoCorp;SplendorPlus;1 Nov 2020;Rhea;5.0; Daily Commute ;Nowadays every young age boy loves to ride a bike, When we are at a teenage or in school having a bike is our first dream.I always had a discussion with my friends in my childhood about which bike i love the most.After growing up when we have our own personal bike it‚Äôs like a dream come true.Riding a bike in a valley or mountain with friends is one of the great feelings.Having a long drive with your bike make you feel cheerful.If you are depressed or feeling lonely, Believe me, Take your bike with you and go for a long drive.

As long as you keep in mind that you are riding a 100 cc Bike you are safe and secure . this is not suitable for long rides { More than 70,80 KM in one go } . If you ride this for more than 100 KM in a day , you will feel very tired and some light back pain. Engine is reliable . i took a ride of 450 KM { 80 KMPH for one hour and half an hour break like this } both up and down. i got 60 KMPL mileage and some back pain not so bad. i am getting 60 KMPL mileage in hyderabad traffic .

HeroMotoCorp;PassionPro;5 Jan 2021;Shreya Gundoju;3.4; Daily Commute ;you may face some minor problems like fuel gauge not showing exact fuel, Speedometer bouncing, I3s works perfectly but i don't recommend to use it because it uses more energy from battery to start resulting in battery drain you will face this major problems like 1st is short you can only do 10 - 15 kmph, 4th gear is slow too you can't even climb a flyover with a pillion engine will stress out a lo t, Clutch is good but it only comes with only 4 gears you can't even do 70 without feeling all the vibrations, Engine is so unrefined you will feel vibrations at every rpm by the way seat is very comfortable until you add a third person final conclusion -i will not recommend passion or splendor or any other bikei think honda shine 125 is the only bike which is refined, Powerful enough to pull 2 people on a flyover or any steep road and also comfortable
HeroMotoCorp;PassionPro;31 Oct 2020;Sunil Rawat;1.8; Daily Commute ;I am not happy with my bike performance & it's features major headache is i3s problem, mileage problem, Self start problem, Meter wiring problem, Engine sounds like water motor, Service station work quality is not good they do their work like a owner not do like a job so i suggest hero bikes are not good and after service experience is very bad even when i go to hero showroom to buy my bike they t reat me like a begger i will buy this bike on 10/9/2019 on cash price but i say no to hero bikes
HeroMotoCorp;PassionPro;17 Oct 2020;Manish Singhal;4.6; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;Overall i had a good experience with Hero and Passion as a combination, My Earlier Bike was as well Hero Passion and it lasted for around 13 years and gave a mileage of around 67-68 KMPH on a consistent basis, The new Passion Pro give me around 60 - 63 KMPH avg. overall better than all other models available in this segment. Even the person who took my earlier bike as resale is still using it effi ciently so Hero hai to Bharosa hai...

Servicing cost of this bike is very good and easy to maintain.SITTING IS COMFORTABLE. it is a stable bike at high speed no vibration. Engine is good. We can drive 100 to 120 km continuously without any problems.CONS Quality of headlight is very poor. its not good for night ride. Suspension is very hard. Chain spocket making noise. It's sea t is very hard. Overall bike is good and cheap to maintain and comfortable for daily riding. I am using this bike from three and in three years, I ride my bike almost 55000 km still engine is good performance is good. I had done 400 km in a day. Its good. But its suspension is and head light creating problem.

HeroMotoCorp;SuperSplendor;10 May 2019;Dewanshu Deka;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Pretty respectable and reliable bike in this segment. The Honda motor performs decent with superior mileage.It feels home in the city with its easy manoeuvrability and traffic can be filtered with ease. On the highways though the underpowered nature of the engine can be felt and bike struggles after 85-90. My bike has a top speed of 105-110 and 0-60 can be done under 6 secs , which is decent. Rest the bike is a good overall package in 125c segment and it truly excels in mileage.

HeroMotoCorp;Xtreme160R;21 Oct 2020;Shakib Ahmed;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Xtreme 160R is the best produce bike from hero till yet. Pros 1) look is just wow. Awesome driving experience for the rider. 2) healthy mileage around 47-52. 3) Initial pick-up is quite interesting as it takes hardly 5 seconds to touch 60kmph. 4) There is hardly vibration if you manage the speed somewhere around 70-90 and it is good enough even on the highway. Don't assume it to drive in a race track. 5) Braking too is very good with the option of the double-disc and the safety of single-channel abs. 6) Fully digital instrument cluster with full led light all around is eye-catching. Note: gear indicator is missing but I don't think it's a big issue. 1) comfort for pillion rider is not satisfying at all as it has short seat, Not comfortable for a long ride. 2)Saree guard is present without footrest- strange. 3) fiber part is of cheap quality is a chronic issue with hero motorcycles. Don't know why they not working on it. 4) wheelbase is low. This is my personal opinion regarding Xtreme 160R. Regards.
HeroMotoCorp;Xtreme160R;18 Sep 2020;Suraj Bansod;5.0; Daily Commute;The best bike in segment, wow mileage is best and service cost is very low I was expecting my first service rate about 700 rupees but it just finished in 350 rupees only. The front suspension and rear monoshock suspension is best, I got full LED setup LED indicator and side stand engine cutoff also it is programmed with Fi technology so it gives me best mileage and low maintenance xtreme is best i n class and best in segment, I will recommend this because everything is inbulid in bike, thanks to Heromotocorp for this bike I loving it
HeroMotoCorp;Xtreme160R;29 Sep 2020;Saurabh Munda;3.8; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Good points: Mileage is the best part, Handling is exceptional.Breaks amazes everytime.ABS is flawless, cant be beaten in any segment.Hazard light implementation is good.Pickup and power is good enough.Negative points:Plastic used in few parts are very cheap ,i.e around headlight.Handle position is tiring during long rides. Wrist and elbow pain.Led head light's not enough luminous.Halogen tail lig ht .Seats design is inappropriate, could have been better.(restricts long rides)Overall good bike , slightly overpriced.
HeroMotoCorp;Xtreme160R;31 Oct 2020;Jitendra Kumar;3.0; Daily Commute ;Hi, I have buy hero xtreme in september 2020.It's a not a satisfied bike.Since staring it's switch of indicator not working properly.Hence two services have done and after one service it's front soccer leakage issue.Which is not repaired in second service as per service centre they don't have its parts.Even no parts available with authorised dealer.Very disappointed with hero motor bikes.
HeroMotoCorp;Xtreme160R;19 Jan 2021;Yash Raj;4.6; Leisure Rides ;Mileage is around 47 km/pl. which is quiet good.Speed performance is good .Comfort at its best. bike has no vibration till 110 km/hr.It has a top speed of 120 km/hr.The only problem is its seat length which is a little small and is difficult for two people to sit at back .overall it is one of the best in segment!

HeroMotoCorp;XPulse200;19 Dec 2019;Salman Farisi;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours;I proudly an owner of xpulse 200.it's good commuter bike and best choice for Indian roadü§£. I brought carb edition on aug 2019. Completed 2 service. I will tell you my 3 month experience about the bike. Pros, Gud design. Better handling. Most affordable budget 200cc bike in the market. Best off-road bike compare with Himalayan very lightweight so we can easily handle. Service cost is very cheap. Advanced digital meter.Low maintenance service cost around 400-500 each service.Build quality is very good.Have 5 year warranty so no worry about that.Gud cornering ability.Gud ground clearance.Suitable to short and tall peoples.No worry about potholes ü§üConsHeating. headlight visibility is poor.Seat comfort is not up to mark.Abs is very sensitive so sometimes break will hard.In my viewpoint it's best for city ride, commuter usage and Off-roading compare with Himalayan . If you looking for touring Himalayan is best because it's seat comfort is far better than xpulse now hero introduce after market seat for touring. Got 44kmpl mileage. Now Xpulse awarded Indian motor cycle of the year 2020. I think my review is helpful for everyone. Thanks for everyone to read my review

HeroMotoCorp;Destini125;10 Nov 2019;Ghjk Bvgh;2.6; Daily Commute ;i thought bike was fantastic but hero proved me wrong. for the initial 2 services bike was good, after that trouble started and bike is turning off when you are traveling despite i3s mode is off. it's getting turned off at signal points..it has become life threatening, when you drove in peak traffic. i don't know what is causing for a new bike to switch off continuously if break is applied.This wa s the first bike that I bought but it's a bitter memory for me. my father suggested to go for activa or access 125 now I had to pay off for my choice.i just wanted hero to fix this issue, i doubt whether they fix or not.

HeroMotoCorp;MaestroEdgeBS4;2 Oct 2019;Kalyan Brata;4.6; Daily Commute ;As a scooter this is quite good at looks and performance. Styling is nice like modern vehicle in this segment. 110CC engine is also performing well in city as well as in highway, but when speed exceed to 60 kmph it makes much sound that power. I have also done some 200 km outing(including hills) with it, and it performs good. You can ride is smooth in between 30 - 50 kmph. Maintenance is also very low, Hero"s parts are also cost less. only issue is with the milage. I am getting 40 - 42 kmpl from the beginning. It will be best if it can manage to give around 50 kmpl for city ride.
HeroMotoCorp;MaestroEdgeBS4;11 Feb 2020;Subhojit Paul;2.6; Daily Commute ;The scooter is great looking from outside but one gets to know about its cons after few days of use. The problems I am facing are:-1. Front tyre leaking from the rim and unable to repair.2. Visor makes noise and really irritating while moving through some bad patch of road.3. Mileage is not that good could have been better.In my view going for Activa 5G would have been a better option.

HeroMotoCorp;MaestroEdgeBS4;24 Nov 2019;Mathias Albert;2.2; Daily Commute;Very bad service. There is big problem in starting system. Engine fails to detect the ignition key.

HeroMotoCorp;XtremeSports;30 Aug 2019;Mohanraj Sam..;1.8; Daily Commute ;I reached 90000Km. Doing periodic service once reached 2000km, I am facing one major problem in this model bike, Stopping the Engine while in the drive, it will happen again I try to rectify the issue with the help of TVS authorized service center, but they won"t give solution to solve this problem. Later the same problem occurred, this time I goto local mechanic, they simply solve the problem by pumped oil in the engine plug hole and start the engine, the actual issue here is piston run with friction. It is the major defect in this Model bike.
HeroMotoCorp;XtremeSports;12 Aug 2019;Pradeep Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute;I preferred this bike at that on my thorough thinking ....like1. It"s unique look and side key position 2. It"s price range (at that price Bajaj pulsar 150 also came but it is owned by many people. So there is no difference between me and group of that persons).3. Hero branding 4. Hero better service chain 5. Cost of maintainance is reasonable Apart from the above points I agreed this was not perf ormed well in market. But I didn"t unhappy had this, because i managed well and I got around avg mileage of 52-54 kmpl. Still now i didn"t found any drastic decrease in mileage and in its performance. I rode my bike with a top speed of 109kmph. I completed 42,000 kilometres in a span of 3 years.
HeroMotoCorp;XtremeSports;19 Apr 2020;Sayan Upadhyay;4.6; Daily Commute ;Best for city commuting as well as highways, mid-range performance is great but not that much stable at top-end. Low maintenance cost. Great mileage--52kmpl at 50-70kmph, 47kmpl 75-100kmph, 40kmpl at 100+. Comfort in next level, sporty nature. The major problem in it is its vibration in foot pegs and rear side, but overall it is a great product from Hero family. I love this bike.
HeroMotoCorp;XtremeSports;1 Aug 2020;Relesh Dewangan;4.6; Leisure Rides;Engine's performance is very very good. Sound is good.For me, it comes after Pulsar 150 when it comes to acceleration.Top Speed is better than expected but it could be more. I took it to 117 km/h on an elevated road although company says 110 and YouTube guys took it only 115.Very Comfy.Tail Light is very attractive.Muscular Tank is needed.

HeroMotoCorp;XtremeSports;24 May 2019;Sayan Khan;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;The bike is good for tall riders because seat is bit wide and I am around 5"9" so sometimes it gets uncomfortable to reach ground . Another thing mileage is really great very punchy engine but if you use it roughly like people uses apache or pulsar , Engine will get noise . And seat is a bit hard so for long tours sometimes it gets uncomfortable

Mileage totally depends on the ride speed. Standard test speed 45-50 kmph gives 60 kmpl. 80-90 kmph gives 42-45 kmpl. 110 kmph gives 33-35 kmpl.

HeroMotoCorp;PassionXPro;21 Jun 2019;Praveen Praveen;2.6; Leisure Rides ;1. Buying Experience: Particularly only middle class people will buy this bike, I bought this bike from a famous showroom in Chennai ( Adyar Motors), First of all they give false commitment, Even before buy service was not good. Delivery Exp > They Make my bike ready with polish installed guards helmet lock ( but not working) Even they not filled the air in tier and didn't even informed me. 2. Ri ding Experience *My First Gear* So happily Started funny butterfly inside me, after second day i found vibration in foot rest 2nd thing every time you put the first gear in morning it produces a lot of sound, i asked to rectify this in my first service but they have not done anything ( Service Given in Palani Motors -Kolathur) and I asked the mechanic about this problem he said this problem is coming in all new model bikes. 3. Performance - Mileage guess ( 65-70km Rs100) Pickup not impressive, Running speed ok, after continues ride of just 12 to 13 km engine heat produce very hot you cant keep legs in right side foot rest, i don't know what to do.Simply saying Please don't buy this Bike Hero Passion Xpro disc.

HeroMotoCorp;HFDeluxeBS4;8 Apr 2020;Rohit Negi;4.2; Daily Commute ;-It really gives me a wonderful mileage i ride around 15 km everyday ( Expect weekends ) still I need to fill full tank only once in a month. - I always did time to time service which makes engine so well being a 100 CC bike its really gives a awesome performance in it's class.- All the parts are original as well.
HeroMotoCorp;HFDeluxeBS4;4 Aug 2020;Kaustubh Kur..;4.2; Daily Commute ;Good one for long duration usage, regular servicing can keep the vehicle ready for each ride, Issues- speedometer cable gets usually down on rough And bumpy road and spark plug gets short in rainy seasonLittle bit increase in cc upto 110 to 125 can make out even best performance out from this bike
HeroMotoCorp;HFDeluxeBS4;15 Jan 2020;Adeeshnoor S..;4.6; Daily Commute ;Overall performance is good enough for a bike that has done 100k kms. Engine still packs punch. Only issue currently is that Cam chain needs to be replaced every 8-10k kms. I am unable to get to the root cause of this issue. Thats the only issue i am currently facing.

HeroMotoCorp;HFDeluxeBS4;4 Oct 2019;SURENDRA SINGH;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;good bike hero bikes are best all in one
HeroMotoCorp;HFDeluxeBS4;11 Sep 2019;Ramyendu Das;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours;This is my first bike, I bought it in December 2017, and till now have driven it more than 15,000 kilometres. Before buying this I drove automatic geared scooters. Obviously, after handling 125cc machines for two and a half years, this machine felt under powered and it took me some time to get accustomed with that lack of power. But then I realised that this machine has it"s own character and it d oesn"t like if one forces it to higer speeds suddenly. However, it can pick up a speed above 70 kmpl on straight highways, without being too noisy, but you have to give it time to attain that speed. Crusing with it at 60-70 kmpl is highly possible and the bike also loves to do it. For daily commuting, it"s just awesome, and thanks to it"s light carb weight, which definitely help the rider to control the bike on bad and broken roads. Manueoverity of this bike is great and gear shifting is butter smooth. Another thing I love about this bike is the engine sound, which is very good. If one drives it at 35-40 kmph speed on fourth gear, it sounds the best. Breaks are not adequate, I must admit, but better when both brakes are applied simultaneously. The lights are not so powerful for dark roads in the night, esp on low beam condition. In one occasion, I have drove it 268 kilometres in a single session, obviously with occasional rests for 5-10 minutes, and didn"t feel any issues from the engine. Also, I took it to hill areas, where one hardly can shift to fourth gear, have to be restricted into second and third gears. As per the looks, my opinion will definitely vary from most of the people, because I find it one of best looking bikes on the road, if you consider it"s just a 100cc bike. Personally I favour a minimal and functional approach for a bike"s design, and from that view point, my bike is just a charming beauty. Now I might say something about the milage, which, I have noticed that vary greatly on this bike, depending on how it"s being handled. I got as low as 50 and as high as almost 80. But in most of the cases, the bike usually gives an above 60 kmpl milage. One more thing is about the servicing. I use to service it at regular intervals as prescribed by Hero, and here in Agartala, the service centre of Niladri motors is very good and efficient. One thing must be remembered about this bike- it"s a low-cost, fuel efficient, lower engine displacement bike, so one might not expect variety of features on it, but whatever it has, is enough for everyday use and occasional tours (which I use to do, touring on holidays and daily commuting on week days). Now about the issues I"ve faced; first of all, initially after buying, it gave me lot of starting problems, but then it was fixed after changing the spark plug. Another thing is, as I have some problems on my lower back, I don"t feel comfortable while driving at a stretch for, say, even half an hour, which could have been solved with a wider seat. The bike"s seat is too narrow, for me, but it may not be a problem with other people who don"t have a chronic lower back pain like me. So, I think that"s all from my side, I would definitely say it"s a lovable bike if the biker is not after speed. I would rather say it"s an all-rounder bike, which can perform different tasks, may not be with that much of perfection which the performance bikes can, but still it has it"s own unique place. And one more thing is, this is the only bike other than Royal Enfield Bullet, that is officially used by the army - I have noticed this bike with official army number plates, at several occasions. That means it has something good definitely.

Honda;Activa6G;28 Jul 2020;Jerush Techs;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;The Fuel injection is the plus point and the BS6 engine is more refined. It‚Äôs very comfortable because of the Telescopic front suspension and adjustable rear suspension but it would have been better if the Disk brake was offered rather than the drum brakes, but the performance is so good and gives a decent mileage as compared to its predecessor. Hope Honda would do their best in bringing the dis k brake option and alloy wheels and more features in their upcoming Activa models.
Honda;Activa6G;25 Nov 2020;Pijus Chakra..;2.6; Daily Commute ;The hooks are user unfriendly.As there is no stay on the hook no bag can be kept.The bag immediately comes out.What has honda gained by putting this type of hook in 6g.All other scooters have proper hook.Opening of seat from the front doesn't makes any sense.As it is one has to get down.Also external fuel also doesn't help as you have to get down to close the fuel cap.So nothing great about this 6 g except being lighter so even ladies can ride it.Groceries cannot be carried.
Honda;Activa6G;22 Dec 2020;Saju Poulose;1.8; Daily Commute ;I brought new activa 6 g 2 weeks ago first day found toomuch shake in front not comfortable to ride.Then back to dealer after 2days get back but still not feel very comfortable.One week later start oil leaking again returns to dealer still with dealer.According to my experience activa 6g having manufactured defects.I feel i did mistake to by new aciva 6g.
Honda;Activa6G;17 May 2020;Dananjay Ana..;5.0; Daily Commute ;Excellent upgrade from the 4G for me.

Honda;Activa125;10 Feb 2020;Tech Life;4.6; Tours;Best scooter available in market now.Little bit on the costlier side, buthas great features compared to other scooters.Giving great mileage(around 52-55kmpl on city), LED lights are also bright and everything is easily visible on dark, so comfortable seat cushioning, what I disliked in it is the 10 inch rear wheel, it must be given 12 inches, as pillion will be more comfortable if done so, and one more annoying thing is the absence of phone charging system, what dissapointed me a lot, but as we know every scooter has its own pros and cons.Finally let's come to conclusion, if you have money enough, then you are surely consider this scooter, as I am absolutely sure that we will not regret buying this product, ‚ò∫‚ò∫
Honda;Activa125;13 Jan 2021;Vivek Jadhav;4.6; Daily Commute;I bought activa 125 bs 6 drum alloy 2 months ago.I am satisfied to have this.Mileage: getting 62kmpl on highways & 50kmpl in city.You can get more when you ride over 35km/h without applying brakes frequently.Comfort: not comfortable for those who are shorter than 5 feet in their height.Styling: bs 6 is well modified but headlight is scattered in night riding.Fuel & engine: when you have 1.5 to 2 l itres petrol left in tank, It starts to feel you that now you need to fill the tank more.So maintain this limits or if not satisfied then purchase the previous models of scooters e.G.5g, 4g.
Honda;Activa125;19 Sep 2020;Gokul Gopakumar;3.4; Daily Commute ;The only thing that is in your mind is engine quality and resale value then you should definitely look for this scooter. Rather if you are looking for an all rounder Don't Even Think of this. The plastic quality , paint quality, headlight throw, starter, etc are below average. The styling of the vehicle is also very much dated. But I think the newer model (bs6) is a kind of different world situati on. There is more features, better styling and all..
Honda;Activa125;18 Nov 2019;Jay B;5.0; Daily Commute;This is a fake review. Very bad vehicle. Very good vehicle. I just tried to see if other reviews are real. So anybody can write anything about any vehicle in zigwheel. My real review... From what I saw in showroom I think bs6 activa 125 deserves 4.5/5. They have introduced lot of real features including fuel injection.. Half mark I reduce because black color is not available maybe deliberately bec ause it sells well. So will be waiting for 6g

Honda;Activa125;20 Jan 2021;Abhilash Harne;2.2; Daily Commute ;Overall experience with activa 125 is okay but not good.I need to change front shock absorber frequently.Weight to power ratio isn't good.Balancing isn't good.Pros - 1.Good for city ride.10kms appx daily2.Sterdy design.3.Good seating area.Cons -1.Mileage isn't good.2.Handling isn't best in traffic.3.Shock absorber aren't comfortable.
Honda;Activa125;20 Dec 2019;Arun Mayanad;4.6; Occasional Commute;All good but didnt like the suspensions . front suspension does not have the free action like other scooters with telescopic suspension, when you press down the handle. rear suspension also on the stiffer side. done only 700 km. hope this improves on run. awaiting feedback on this from other activa bs6 owners...
Honda;Activa125;19 Jul 2020;Raymond Brag..;3.8; Daily Commute ;Comfortable, smooth n reliable. Good braking. Good handling. Since certain scooter parts r made of fiber, they tend to vibrate after certain time. Good suspension too. Overall happy with the scooter. Top speed on road solo is around 90kmph.

Honda;Activa125;12 Sep 2020;Murugesh Vellu;3.0; Daily Commute ;Cons - - It is not silent start as specified. Makes more noise than expected- Accessories fitment not smooth.

Honda;Activa125;10 Nov 2019;Ram Krrish;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;Comfortable ride. The shock absorbers should have been improvised and the Boot space should have been increased. Apart from these both, a perfect scooty with all latest features.

The torque pull on the bike can compete the 500cc‚Äôs to an extent but can outclass other bike on the same segment. Heads turn when your on this bike, looks are classy.

Honda;CBR250R;21 Jul 2020;Shahrukh shaikh;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;I've been using CBR250R ABS for more than half a decade now. I'll categorize my review: Performance: The bike is smooth in initial(typical Honda) but as soon as you cross 6K rpm, the Bike shoots a boost of power. The torque is really good from mid to high range, particularly from 6K to 9K, the front wheel wants to lift & I get goosebumps. Honda engine is very smooth, stress free & reliable, never got broken or overheated thanks to liquid cooled, zero problems with radiator.Breaks: I bought the ABS version, it gets Nissin calipers which are one the Top best breaks in terms of quality & reliabiity in the segment, the breaks never ever disappoint me, unless tires are bad.Suspension: The front suspensions are party smooth, but takes the city bumps quite good, but very sensitive to feel on your palms but the rear suspension is bit on harder side.Tires: This bike is less of track focused but more as Sport tourer, the Stock Contigo tires does average job, i recommend to change them soon or after 20K kms after bike purchase & which to Michelin Pilot streets or Apollo Alpha H1, they're quite good interms of Corner & Wet grips & also has decent life, for Fun rides Your choose Pirelli diablo rosso or Metzeler M5.Lights: The Halogen headlight is pretty good & LEDs of new model is slightly better but I recommend the halogen once, they have good spread and visibility than any other bikes. Indicators are quite visible & overall everything is stylish.Console: The bike gets semi digital console which is pretty accurate, info is enough for the bike, Speedo, odo, Total kms, 1 trip meter, Fuel level, Heat indicator & ABS light. Zero issues.Chassis & Dimensions: The Honda's built quality can never be doubted although you have to take precautions of lot of things which depends upon your riding conditions.The Ground clearance is 145mm but i never scratched the bottom of engine because it doesn't have center stand.The windshield protects the air until 90 kmph or less.In crosswinds the bike sometimes gets wobbles.The weight of the bike is not much but can become nightmare in pulling bike in tight parking also due to longer wheelbase and small turning angle, but Shorter seat height helps alot.Comfort: Rider seat is medium soft but you can easily tour for whole day, Rear seat is short but good for upto medium sized pillion, but pillion starts complaining after half hour but start getting used to after regular rides.Front footpegs are quite rearset and upward to give you sporty feeling but comfortable. The seating positions of rider is medium forward, not straight or aggressive, which helps in longer rides.Mileage:In very aggressive riding(Top end, drag or stunts): 24kmplIn City commuting: 26-28kmpl for speeds 0-60kmphIn Highway & tours: 30-36kmpl for speeds 90-110kmphOverall mileage 28kmplMaintenance cost: Service cost is around 1700 to 2200 depends upon the conditions, Extra service may cost extra but this is very budget friendly. Various types of Tire sets are available from 5k to 13k for a Pair, depend upon your choice & need.Break pads are for 1600 each for ABS & 950 for Non-ABS.check the link for all Accessories & part values on:htt******htmAdditional note: Bike doesn't have center stand so the repairing a puncture or changing the tires or cleaning-lubing the chain can be surprising.
Honda;CBR250R;28 Jul 2019;Shanks 857;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Stay away from Honda CBR-250Rs BS4 editions. Beware it‚Äôs just the name Honda Sells in India not a quality product or service now a days. I am already a victim of this, so just sharing my experience. Most of the ownership reviews you find online are for older editions which make you fall for CBR250R if you like refinement.So does most of the bike rental services like Wicked Ride or DriveZy have o lder 2016-17 editions and they are awesome to experience.That was my validation & research before I bought the CBR on May 11th 2019. (CBR 250R Sep 2018 Manufactured)Issues I faced from day 1 of bike delivery are: HMSI Ticket No 1-71490982781.1.Heavy engine vibrations due to slipped engine mount bolts also they replaced Rocker arm, CAM, Shims & Sprocket set to address overall vibrations. 2.Handle wobbling between 70-80 kmph, they replaced Cone set assembly and didn‚Äôt resolve the issue. It seems they are defective tyres, they replaced rear tyre still issue not resolved.3.Metal clicking noise from frames and under tank. Issue was addressed by applying foam tape between frame (chassis) and Tank and Side body panels.4.ASC damaged radiator during water wash- which they had to replace after a fight proving their incompetence.Most of the new BS4 CBRs have these vibrations issues just check any CBR forum on FB or online.. In a nutshell you might be lucky to get a good unit. However, ASCs service competence is crap. You will suffer with their trial and error method of fixing issues.They trust in your patience to cover their incompetence. My 79 days old CBR250 R spent 30 days in ASCs- 8 attempts - still handle wobbling issue is not fixed. HMSI BLR regional head is also aligned for this since 3 weeks for last 3 attempts.
Honda;CBR250R;6 Nov 2019;Robin Chikku;4.6; Tours;The bike had a butter smooth engine , and made almost zero sound comparing to others. The vibrations were the least of all the single cylinder bikes that I had ridden. It was light weight and IIt weighs only 167 kilograms, and feels even lighter. The mileage rating is around 35 kmpl and itThe engine is the smoothest amongst all the single cylinder bikes and there is very less engine noise. This bi ke is known for its touring capabilities and it sure is, it can easily do highway speeds. waiting eagerly for Honda to launch cbr300 in any time üòÖüòÖüòá
Honda;CBR250R;3 Nov 2020;Robin Godson;4.2; Tours ;I own a cbr250r and i learnt that its very common in cbr250, That there is that ticking sound in the engine when its hot or after a long use.Which makes the bikes feel so old or wrecked.And i've heard people talked about how they try to fix it but failed.I too have this problem for a while and yesterday i went to the local workshop and they told me that it might be the 'tension', And of course the y fix it for me and charged me only.If you have this kind problem, Please, Its the tension.Many mechanics don't know this.Hope that helps.
Honda;CBR250R;26 Aug 2020;Shubhankar K..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;I went for the CBR in late 2019 so that must explain how much I love the damn thing so everyy thing ill be saying is straight up pgoing to be biased but yeah why not go with what your heart says and share that, so yeah the bike dispite its downside and lack of modern features is better to me than like every other motorcycle out there, im super happy with it and it makes me take the long route home so yeah :)
Honda;CBR250R;12 Jul 2020;Mohammad Khan;4.6; Occasional Commute | Leisure Rides;It is reliable and well put together . fuel efficient , I get 32 kmpl . 26 BHP is good power but low end torque could be better . below 3500 rpm the engine feels sluggish. once past 4000 rpm the performance is good . have hit 152 KMPH on it but it will reach 135 easily and then it takes time .overall a good bike but getting old .
Honda;CBR250R;25 Dec 2020;Vishwavijay ..;5.0; Tours ;Honda cbr250r is fantastic motorcycle.Things which i really like are looks, Durability, Softer suspension setup and performance to some extent.But still require more power, Feels slightly heavy to handle and due to taller gear ratios feels slower as well.Still good motorcycle for touring.

The quality and comfort are the main usp of this bike. Where it lags is the low end torque. Initial pick up is much less than its competitors. If you love to race singnal to signal, this bike will not make you happy. This is for a lovely long ride.

Honda;Activa5G;21 Jan 2020;Ajinkya Beda..;1.0; Daily Commute;This is the fact story of how I lost FAITH in HONDA TWO WHEELERS INDIA LTD. I was having good experience with Honda activa since 2011 to 2015 as I was having it in my college days.So in my first job I purchased HONDA ACTIVA 5G LIMITED EDITION on 9TH OF JAN 2020. on very next day of it delivered to me I face the issue of Handle vibration while pickup at start. So I visited the PILOT HONDA SHOWROOM, BHANDUP , MUMBAI from where I purchased the vehicle. They told me that vehicle takes time to get free up so, wait for few days. So I waited for few days. But the problem persisted and is still there. So I visited the showroom again, they asked me to visit their service center. So I visited it today. Serviceman told me that the problem might be with clutch. And they told me the reason behind it 1) Dust in Clutch parts 2) applying break while raising accelerator.But on very second day I faced the same issue and when I visited service center It was just 148 Kms I drove the vehicle. I literally LOSS the FAITH IN HOND TWO WHEELERS INDIA LTD.THEY GAVE ME FAULTY MODEL. HOW CAN CLUTCH BECOME PROBLEM ON VERY NEXT DAY OR JUST DRIVING OF 148 KMS (WHEN I QM OFFICIALLY RAISING THE COMPLIANT IT IS 148 KMS).VERY VERY SAD AND BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE REPUTED AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURER

Pick up will come smoothley if you accelerate instantley . And beside of these two things this activa is best ever from any till date and long on it will be remane it positive points is 1.its build quality of its materal is top nou ch there is no problem with this because my activa 2016 model and i have drives 40,000 km and I face no problem with quality of product and it will also give average of 45 per litre after 5 year of buying .and over it is best activa in the India. And you will enjoy riding it between speed of 10to 60 very sporty felling comes. And over all best in every department üòò

I will have to push the vehicle for at least half kilometer and use kick start to start the vehicle.I contacted the dealer regarding the same and they have no clue about this problem. I got reply that this kind of problem is happening because of ne w bs norms. It seems many customers are having the same problem and they asked me adjust with the problem as there is no solution to it. Please don"t buy honda vehicle and make your life hell!!!!!

I weigh 100kgs and I use it to bring cow dung manure which also weigh 50 kg each sack..I usually take 1 sack and keep it in the footsack area and one in the passenger seat..so the combined weight is 200kg..it pulls up with minimal effort when we think about the weight...the built quality is awesome..but I don't prefer the front suspensio n because it doesn't offer a good ride and corner confidence when you ride hard

Honda;Activa5G;13 Oct 2020;Sreesha Srin..;1.8; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides;One of the worst experiences. We have been using this activa for 3 years, just 25k km. Every service some or the other part is being replaced. Vehicle shuts down on long runs ~10 km at a stretch. In terms of features. It's not that great. All basic and nothing special as such. Never going for this again !!

Honda;Activa5G;11 Jun 2019;Club INQUIZI..;1.0; Daily Commute ;Irresponsible Activa Team - Change the Head Lamp first.We did not expect from a company like Honda to have a LED head lamp that is too Intense causing lot of discomfort to the commuters. It is highly irresponsible on the part of Design team of Activa 4G or 5G.Also there is a problem with mileage and start.I request the Activa Management to look into this matter before someone drags you to the cour t for their inappropriate decision of having a very bad head lamp.Activa Team, Be responsible. These type of issues will pull down your reputation.

Activa has Steel body that"s why no vibration noise in body. Good space in dikki. Also Mobile charger is available. Worth for price . But I think Activa 4G is better compared to 5G. Becouse in city rides average is most important thing.and 4G is well doing that.

Honda;Activa5G;5 Oct 2020;Harsh Panchal;5.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;Best in scooter range. There is no one who can beat activa in scooter section. Just need to make sure with the maneuver because tyres are small and they can easily lose the grip.

I faced this two problems... white mercury halogen lights are very dull lighting.. when yellow light vehicles passes my bike.. my bike headlight was completely zero view.. Its waste to keep that white lights on bikes... it's very dangerous to opposite direction vehicles may cause accidents more.. day light running lights are waste .. I don't know who made Modi ji as Prime Minister.. he don't have manners using Led lights if head lamp light not working entire head lamp set need to change.. good business tricks for government and honda manufacturers... good business tricks.. see old bikes if head light not working we can change bulb and drive.. but using this Led light white we can't change the bulb or anything in bike entire head lamp set need to change... plastic products bike.. fully gets faded within one year.. plastic fittings if button locks are broken entire fitment need to change the part.. few months once went in rough roads all plastic sounds and screws will be removed easily.. 90% of vehicle is made of plastic.. only alloy wheels chase and handle bar was made of metal.. I don't know whats there in this bike to spend 1,08,000 onroad price... I can get same bike avenger fully metal based and twin spark plugs and stylish. and metal products.. disappointed of using this bike.. front tyres are like Tvs 50 tyres less width .... it doesn't have abs or dual disc.. no k**l switch... heavy loss for users who buy this bike.. Unicorn and shine itself have better metal body.. stop this bike production. don't purchase this bike... 160 CC segment please choose APACHE AND FZ AND PULSAR AND AVENGER AND NS160
Honda;XBladeBS4;1 Mar 2020;Trendy Tamizhan;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Honda X Blade is a completely 'Underrated bike'...Many people says TVS Apache RTR 160 4V is a best bike in 160cc bike...Well, I Accept it! I think...Honda X-Blade is the second place in 160cc segmant...This is best commuting bike with very lot look !Pros: 50 to 54 kmpl any type of riding style in city...on highways definitely gives 55 kmplrobo-face LED headlamp, Gear Position Indicator, soft suspe nsion seat setup, hazard light switch, fully digital instrument cluster, 130/70 section rear tyre with hugger, low maintenance seal chain, a dual-port exhaust muffler which delivers a punchy exhaust note, Very Comfortable seat for rider and pillion, Upright handle bar gives painless long rides.I drive maximum speed 123 kmph on my bike (rider only) & 119 kmph speed (rider and pillion)Single channel ABS Braking on front wheelCons: Slim Front Tyre (but its offer to good milaege), LED light brightness is average
Honda;XBladeBS4;9 Feb 2020;Rakesh Pal;3.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Bike is good, but due to slim front tyre, it's not convenient for long highway rides. Better for city. Mileage is good. Light Heavyweight Bike 140KGRider height under 5'6' may be a problemStarting problem may occurNo engine k**l switch but stock hazard switch available.No rear disc.Illumination is good (LED Headlights and DRLs)3 people can ride very comfortably (it's illegal though!)Cruising withi n 65-75 kmphNo LED IndicatorsFit and finish level is satisfactory, not so high.
Honda;XBladeBS4;25 Feb 2020;;4.6; Daily Commute ;It's the first bike I have purchased by my own. it was been under track when it was been introduced on YouTube 2 years prior of it's launch. it is very much comfortable for both single and double riders.Weight is also great. Awasome engine sound but mileage is about 45-50 kmpl. Head light is also superb quality. it's also very much Trustable. Maintenance is almost Zero.I am very happy with my sele ction always well as the muscle hunk. thank you Honda for such an invention.
Honda;XBladeBS4;2 Oct 2018;RAJA SEKHAR;5.0; Daily Commute ;PRO"S:Great looks- beats all the competition hereMileage: 48+kmpl in city with agressive driving and reaches to 55kmpl when driven at 50-70kmph. good enough.Price: its competitive @92K on road with all accessories.Engine performance and ride quality: Super smooth engine and clutch. Drove 100km at once without any strain.-Comfort for rider and pillion are the best in its segment.Con"s:A bit lag com es during 3rd gear by surprise, but throttle response is super in 4th and 5th gear too along with super smooth 1st and 2nd gear.-No engine kill switch (can be adjusted) but have hazard lights which is a new one.-could have provided back disk as an option Verdict: Best bike for daily usage who wants a stylish ,powerful,practical yet budget friendly one. Excellent bike to travel around city.
Honda;XBladeBS4;7 Jun 2020;Deepak S;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours;Good bike ...brought 6 months back. Stylish look,Comfortable for riding. Peeformance of Breaking was awesome. Regarding gear shifting problem faced between 4 and 5twice in last 6 months , but not making trouble for us. Suddenly speed is decreasing. Totally 2k km was over. No other problem faced.Good bike it's neither cheaper nor costlier.
Honda;XBladeBS4;14 Nov 2018;Nakul Sharma;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours ;The bike has very good looks , the performance is adequate for city but you can feel the need for a bit more power on highways , mileage is excellent as I am getting 55-60 kmpl in this 4 months of ownership , by Keeping highway speeds below 75 kmph and not exceeding 5500 rpm in city , comfort is not excellent as I have experienced pain in my hands while riding but I think I am yet to find the best seating position for this bike , if you want a bike for daily commute and occasional highway rides you can definitely go for it instead of other bikes in the segment , always wear helmet , cheers
Honda;XBladeBS4;28 Sep 2019;Vishal Thakor;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;X Blade is a very good combination of a commuter bike and a sports bike.... It give one a comfort of a commuter bike with the power of a sports bike....Pros: Excellent Power, good mileage, Stylish,great pickupCons: Short chrome on silencer is risky, Gear is not smooth, Battery has to be recharged every second month.
Honda;XBladeBS4;21 Jan 2020;Taufiq Poona..;4.6; Daily Commute;The performance of the bike is pretty good, but there is no disc brake and honda has decreased the power in this bike compared to hornet. That's why I am not fully satisfied with this bike. Otherwise it is a very fabulous bike in comparison with other bikes in the market.
Honda;XBladeBS4;22 Aug 2019;Abhijit Jadhav;3.0; Daily Commute;Its Average. I did not find anything different in this bike. Comfort, power, style, luxury everything is normal. But for everyone my suggestion for engine oil is Divyol Oil to use. The bike will run like anything. It will be more awesome like you have purchased it new.
Honda;XBladeBS4;13 Aug 2020;Mithun Sharma;4.6; Tours ;Nice bike to ride in Mountain erea. Comfortable and safe. Value of money buying this bike. Easy handling ,good looking, mailage is good also. Easy to maintain in small money

Honda;XBladeBS4;18 Mar 2019;Gokul Pawar;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;The perfect bike in 160cc segment.Pick Up and Comfort both are tuned.Other 160cc bikes does not provide both these things at a time.I ride my bike 150km everyday but still I feel fresh and energetic after returning to home at night.Overall, the bike is just stunning..

Honda;XBladeBS4;23 Dec 2019;Notorious 1;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;This is the smoothest bike in this segment. Performance is very punchy in low and mid range. Still does a good top speed of 125-127 kph. Comfort is also really good. You can get mileage of 50-55 kmpl doesn't matter how you rode it. Best looks in the segment. Highway cruising speed is also good at 80-90 kph without any vibrations. Engine sounds great inside the helmet when I'm on highways. There ar e two drawbacks though: no rear disc brake and front tire is thin 80/80. The bs6 varient will get a killswitch and rear discbrake. Overall it is really good :)
Honda;XBladeBS4;30 Aug 2019;Krishna Jadhav;3.8; Daily Commute ;Height is too much so NO one likes to sit.Overall this bike is good but as per price they have to some more than this

Honda;GraziaBS4;28 Mar 2019;Sagar Manthen;3.0; Daily Commute ;1. Buying experience:Was not so good as I bought it from a private dealer and advise to always buy from authorized dealers on a negotiated price.2.Riding experience:I bought this scooty in Feb month of 2018 year. Initially the pickup and riding experience was pretty smooth and nice. Gradually the pickup is decreased/engine sound increased and it is not at expected levels now after running it for a round 11500kms. Good thimg about this scooty is it does not shake even if you are at a speed of 90-95 kmh. I did not face any engine starting issue as reported by many. Suspension is way too bumpy and throws off a rider/pillion which is not a good sign.Foot rest position for a pillion is not designed to be comfort. One has to remove feet from footrest in traffic otherwise rider"s feet collides with pillion. Tail gabrail should have been of what old activa model provides as it is more protective during pickup. 3. Details about looks, performance etc. :I give 5/5 to looks. Scooty is stylish and modern. I still feel very competitve and new to ride it in town. Overall performance is good but the mileage is very less than what I expected and company claimed. I only get 35 kmpl in town riding which is very less considering 125cc engine.4. Servicing and maintenance:After 2nd servicing, choke cable broke down and petrol used to get wasted inside even if the choke is pulled off. Servicing mechanic told that this is something new to face and eventually replaced the cable to resolve it. Apart from that did not face any issue. Timely maintenance is must to achieve or maintain smooth riding experiences. 5. Pros and Cons:Pros:Great in looks and style.Brand value. Latest features like LED lights, completely new speedometer which works and displays good even in sunlight and charging facility. Power packed variant with 125cc engine.Cons:Less on-road-mileage. Bumpy suspension.
Honda;GraziaBS4;31 Jan 2020;MILAN KUMAR;3.4; Daily Commute;The attractive features of Grazia, as I find, are it's sporty look, head lamp design and fully digital console. The most disadvantage of this scooter is its body material, which is fully plastic which can merely survive any chunk of crashes. Despite of having the plastic body, it's weight is highest among all Honda scooters. Plastic body material might have been used to lower its curb weight, and to give the scooter it's characteristic sporty look.
Honda;GraziaBS4;22 Oct 2019;Karishma Kar..;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides;I brought grazia in the month of may 2019 , it has been already 6 months till now . BEST THING about grazia is its stylish look which makes it attractive mainly starlight black .I love to take my grazia for smooth drift over hairpin bend roads ...good balance though starting I felt bit heavy , but once you get used to it ...its most comfortable one ...and good performance over long rides in high s peed .
Honda;GraziaBS4;25 Dec 2019;Kanteshwar B..;2.2; Daily Commute;This moped has no serviceability. Mechanics are not able to understand the disassembly of the parts the mileage is only 40kmpl really I drove it for 20000 KM's Very high maintenance cost. The rear shock absorber angle is not optimum with chassis due to which the rear suspension is hard and cannot give comfort to pavilion. I suggest all people to see the performance rather than looks
Honda;GraziaBS4;17 Jan 2020;Mahesh Yadav;1.8; Daily Commute;grazia.. I'm not happy with This vehicle bcoz starting it vas gud later the vehicle started giving me a lot of trouble so I felt very sad n after I sold it n i purchased activa 5g it is better than grazia look vise n performance nw I'm feeling happy with This vehicle.. guys dnt go for grazia really waste of money I suggest you people 5g n access 125 n Jupiter
Honda;GraziaBS4;1 Dec 2019;Prabhu Raj;5.0; Daily Commute ;am using honda grazia from past 2 years friends belive me it is very good scooter.same like activa but if you want new look than take it.activa is boring in every parking you can see somany scooters even you confused where is yours in that.and mainly am talking about mileage I got 70km per rupees petrol.yes really if maintain properly grazia is awesome.
Honda;GraziaBS4;12 Jan 2021;Daiyaan Khan;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;One of the best scooters.I bought the royal blue one, Gives the best look.Performance is better than activa 5g.I have both activa 5g and grazia, The performance of grazia is better.Especially when i drive in very bad roads, It gives a comfortable feel, But in activa 5g my back starts paining.
Honda;GraziaBS4;6 Jan 2020;Soumyarup Paul;2.2; Daily Commute ;There's a huge issue with starting the bike and sometimes even keep it running. The authorized service center engineers are not able to find a permanent solution to the issue and hence are not that dependable. I definitely would not suggest this scooter to any potential buyer.
Honda;GraziaBS4;14 Nov 2019;Shyam Kumar;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;At starting i felt disappointed with this .but after its 1year completed and crossed 10,000 km .Now i am fully satisfied with my scooty .it is giving 50kmpl mileage ,excellent pickup and less maintenance cost.
Honda;GraziaBS4;28 Jan 2019;Premnath Div..;5.0; Daily Commute ;The vehicle is well balanced enabling the rider to take tight turns with sharp angles of inclination unusual for a scooter generally. Engine power on tap for such manoeuvres is excellent as there is no stall. Gives great confidence as chances of slip and slide are remote. The digital dashboard is ideally designed and incorporating a clock is thoughtful and useful in daily commute.
Honda;GraziaBS4;13 Jan 2021;Sagar;3.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;The bike only looks good.Mileage, Pickup, Smoothness is not present here.Though the maintenance is not much eventually end up fuelling every week rs.200 for total 4 km travel a day.
Honda;GraziaBS4;13 May 2019;Sankar Dey;1.0; Occasional Commute ;The body quality is very bad. I bought new grazia but the plastic quality of the scooty very very poor.

Overall very bad experience.
Honda;GraziaBS4;18 Jan 2021;Grsnikhil Sai;4.6; Tours ;Superb bike with stylish looks and the mileage it gives around 40kmpl.Only the problem it's a plastic body.We want to maintain with some care.Overall it's good good one.

Honda;Cliq;13 Nov 2020;Shashank Juv..;4.6; Daily Commute ;Overall a good commuter scooter but just small fuel tank bothers a lot. 3.5 liter petrol tank requires frequent visit to petrol pump. Although it looks small but its monster when comes to performance. Off-road knobby tires helps in easy commuting specially on bad patchy roads. Works well below 60 kmph only above that its starts to wobble. No fancy dashboard. All analogue on this one creates proble m with petrol filling. Most of time its difficult to understand how much petrol it got. Even in reserve mode sometimes it keeps on running even 30 km.

Honda;CRF1000LAfricaTwin;11 Jan 2019;Leon Dave;5.0; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute;I have no regrets picking up the AT, I didn't honestly think that I could use it as my commuter too. It just doesn't heat up in bad traffic like we have in Bangalore. The maintenance of the bike is just plain affordable. You have to get it serviced twice a year or 6k kms whichever comes first. The service cost is normally less than 5k. Its a super comfortable bike and the best off road bike in the market. It is unbelievably reliable. The city average is anywhere between 14 to 18kms and on the highway between 27 to 32 kms. I have had the bike for a little more than 6 months and there are no regrets picking up the AT. I had originally booked another brilliant machine and canceled the booking in the last minute to go for this one. Its been a wonderful riding experience.

Honda;Navi;24 Aug 2018;Rajiv Rajan;4.6; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Leisure Rides ;Honda Navi covers the Monkey bike segment in India which no other manufacturers do, inspired by the mx125/Grom from the same stable Honda in actually researched & developed in India by Honda India engineers. Good for city usage also if with a pillion then 25 kms & above travelling can be cramped. Rest the performance according to the specs is really good.

Honda;CBShineSP;18 May 2020;Arpit Acharya;4.6; Daily Commute ;The best part of this engine is that you will not hear it until revved too hard, its smooth, its silent and 60 kmph is its sweet spot to be. City rides would be buttery smooth but i will not recommend this for highways as due to its short gearing the fifth gear is pretty useless. and if you go beyond 60 kmph it will feel strained and there will be noticeable vibrations too. i totally expect this i ssue will be there in sp 125 bs6 too as when i rode it it felt less punchy, not to forget that bs6 version is Fuel Injected so its power delivery stays linear throughout. i cant tell you that at what rpm the engine is performing well as there's no tachometer. Brakes perform pretty well and the front disc has a great stopping power the weight of the bike is very accommodating and it it gives you a big bike feel too. I find styling of bs4 version better than the bs6 ones. My overall verdict would be that if its your choice for city commutes with a very refined engine you are not going wrong..!
Honda;CBShineSP;15 Mar 2020;Arun Rajput;1.8; Daily Commute;I buy Honda Sp Shine 125cc in april'2018 and my experience is very bad with this bike. *Not a good bike *During riding do not feel good (may be alignment not ok of this bike) because *Since i bought this bike i feel problem chain getting out when loose.*Accessories Very Bad Quality e.g. switch and lighting system very bad. *Switch press movements not soft specially indicator switch and *Passing sw itch do not work proper in rain and *Handle left grip always rotate in rainy days and *When switch on high beam switch then low beam light not work and*When press passing light then both light work.*Chain Set need to change on16000Km ride only.
Honda;CBShineSP;3 Sep 2020;Joydeep Mukh..;4.2; Daily Commute ;Initially, my bike was giving a mileage of 55 to 58km. But, after 6servicing and mobil change after every 2000 kms, the mileage has gone up to 68kms. Smooth driving. But, when the speedometer touches 70kmph, it starts a mild j**k and engine becomes noisy.The disgusting part is headlight. It should be replaced with good led headlights.
Honda;CBShineSP;20 Jan 2020;ABHAYA KUMAR;2.2; Occasional Commute;This is very bad for both sacpchar . This is very bad for gear change on running time and start time.

Honda;CBShineSP;21 Jan 2019;Rewanth Rao;4.2; Daily Commute ;Usual service of every 2500km interval service will cost you an average of 2000. Over a period of 2 years. Havent had any major problems so far. Excellent control of the vehicle. Will do 90kmph easily. Sometimes vibration will be there after 70kmph. Upto 60 kmph its very smooth. The specification of the fuel tank is 11 Litres but i can actually load upto 13 Litres. Overall a great choice for econo my ride in city and a small highway trips.
Honda;CBShineSP;7 May 2020;Subhasish Na..;5.0; Daily Commute ;According to Engine & performance it is best for me as a middle class citizen. But the fiber body is not1durable like old HERO HONDA . I am servicing it around 3 to 4 months interval & after servicing, I feel it is1a new one .

Honda;CBShineSP;17 Sep 2020;Utpal Bar;5.0; Daily Commute;Engine is very smooth, mileage away some, maintenance cost minimum, good style, shock absorbers very smooth, but gear changing is a problem otherwise it is a very good bike in this segment for daily use.

Honda;CBShineSP;28 Sep 2019;Anand K;3.0; Daily Commute ;Good in Comfort and pick up compared to this segment. If we drive above 65kmph mileage is dropping. If we drive in 50kmph good mileage and very less vibration
Honda;CBShineSP;29 Dec 2018;Nishit Shah;5.0; Daily Commute ;It is very good bike with mileage around 65-70.i got 67kmpl. Style is eye catching. And everyone is looking when i ride it. Gear shifting is little hard. But will be soft after 5000km. Gear padal is also very long. It should be litle short. Otherwise overall experience good till now.
Honda;CBShineSP;6 Aug 2020;Rahul Ranjan;3.0; Daily Commute ;It is good for daily commuter but not for long ride. It also has less road grip and low pickup. Honda's engine is reliable but it is not for off road.
Honda;CBShineSP;27 Dec 2018;Onkar Bhosale;4.2; Daily Commute ;I have cbs version, giving a reassuring brake response. I like its overall nature, the torque low range and nice and smooth cruise (about 50kmph). You may consider it's stiffer suspension which makes it better option for smooth and plain roads.

Honda;LivoBS4;26 Aug 2019;Azam Sheikh;3.8; Occasional Commute ;I have been riding livo for 1 year and it's been great. Comfort wise it's not the best bike because of its stiff suspension and somewhat hard seat, other than that styling and look is best in its segment. I haven"t try to check the mileage but I think it gives me around just over 55 kmpl and anyday below 60. I have Bajaj discover 100, I guess it"s 8 years old, but still gives output of 65- 70 kmpl , therefore if ur a mileage oriented person. You can opt for Bajaj and tvs bikes as they are good at it. If ur a tall person 6.1ft like me u can consider it a viable option.
Honda;LivoBS4;16 Aug 2018;Devendra Singh;4.7; Daily Commute ;To all friends who are short listing Livo as their first bike, or the next to the previous one or to transport fully loaded‚Ä¶.or for the bumpy no-road areas‚Ä¶.Just say yes!

Finally I arrived to the Honda‚Ä¶as I read the comments and it was already my first choice. NOT TO MENTION THE BLUE COLOR‚Ä¶WHICH I ACTUALLY WANTED AND EVENTUALLY GOT. I was given a test drive and I was left with no doubts that this is what I wanted.Now, I have been driving it for 2 months now‚Ä¶no complaints yet. It is an all-rounder bike. My pros and Cons are below‚Ä¶Pros‚Ä¶Fuel efficiency and mileage ,Great Looks and design,Good ground clearance,Good fuel tank capacity,for long drives,Very comfortable seats (front as well as back) Cons:Not suitable for drag racing ,No LED DRLs

Honda;CBUnicorn160;29 Nov 2020;Vasireddy Tu..;3.4; Daily Commute ;Unicorn is not new to many, So when compared to the previous version the bike is almost same expect the engine.The bs6 version comes with fuel injection engine which does not have a carburetor and fuel reserve option.As it comes with fuel injection mechanism the bike auto accelerates at the time of start and does not come to normal for a few minutes.This hinders the confidence of a rider.Expect th e auto acceleration issue everything is fine with the bike.The price is a bit high even though it increased the engine power and carrying capacity.

Honda;DreamNeo;2 Mar 2020;Antony Patrick;2.2; Daily Commute ;Honda dream neo parts replacement done from Honda authorised service center yet the parts does not last even a year compared to the parts given by Honda company through OEM. I have changed side stand, light, horn,cluch plate, clutch cable, chain sprocket,brake shoes,etc etc but the replacement product although certified by Honda is much inferior product compared to the OEM. The neo for the last 4 years can't meet pollution emission norm. This year puja I will buy a euro 6 commuter bike and I will choose a different brand. Before neo I had Honda eterno, Honda aviator and now neo. Service and spare parts of Honda is very poor in Kolkata. Time to give chance to a different brand. Maybe hero brand. Patrick Gomes

Honda;DreamYuga;14 Feb 2020;Vyomesh Rathwa;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours ;mileage is Depend upoon you how you are driving with proper maintainance. In city you will get hardly 65 km/h (congested traffic) while on national highways Gives 75 km/l.(Speed Under 65km/h,Above 80 km/h mileage can decrese) maintenance cost too high of you go for Paid Service and Gives useless comments regarding bike like your brake shoes defected need to replace. Within 2 months etc .
Honda;DreamYuga;1 Jun 2020;Asish Ghosh;3.4; Daily Commute ;Low mileage, Morning Start Problem if idle for 3-4 days, lowest top speed in the segment, vibrates above 65 Km/hr. Upside - Very low maintenance, light, easy to handle in crowd, and very less time taken from 0-50. I bought this for its sleek look. :) I will recommend it if 80% of your commute is within the city. On the highways it is terrible.
Honda;DreamYuga;11 Feb 2020;Amar Dey;3.8; Daily Commute ;Better mileage, low maintenance cost & superb performance . You will get smooth journey without any vibration . But , it has no style overall & this bike is need one more gear . Afterall , this bike is not made for daily long journey . You must have to take care of this bike like a 'MAN' .
Honda;DreamYuga;2 Apr 2019;Bhaskar Boss;4.6; Daily Commute ;I usually prefer to drive bikes for long distance, after buying bike I stopped travelling in bus. It is a very comfortable bike for long drives. Seat would have been better, otherwise perfect for long drives. less maintainance(800rs per 3000km) I had never took rest even after riding 400kms in a single stretch. I drive the bike at optimum speed(45-65 kmph) with out any break. I m getting 65-75 kmp l mileage. I m writing this review after 4yrs of usage. I m planning for a trip to goa , I will share my experience once I return back to salem.

Honda;DioBS4;8 May 2020;Nikhil Asodekar;5.0; Daily Commute ;Considering 110cc engine, Honda Dio is one of the finest bike, I use it for a daily travel of about 40mk. Though Honda claims a mileage of 55kmpl I have got up to 62kmpl. I always use premium petrol for my vehicle.I have gone for long distance drive twice upto 500km in a day. It comfortable reaches 70Kmph. It doesn't show any change in performance, but I would suggest to give intermittent rest aft er 2-3 hours riding.Best vehicle for every day use.Some people feel uncomfortable pillion seat, but the reason is the accessories, that block the footrest.Dio is very light weight and easy to balance vehicle, with big central light to give good illumination, but on dark roads. Headlight supplied by company is not bright enough.You have to take care for coarse roads, as the body is fiber/plastic. damages may be costly to repair.some shortcomings include, no pass light, weak headlight, fiber body About company service center, I am not that happy, since i noticed deteriorated performance after few of the services. but, it solely depends upon the service personnel performance, I would suggest changing oli, filters and battery that's more than enough.
Honda;DioBS4;7 Jan 2019;Vinodh Vs;2.2; Daily Commute ;Riding comfort is average. If you ride as pillion and you have below average height it's uncomfortable due to its pillon foot rest in an awkward position back pain is guaranteed. If you are an above average height person, congrats !!! you will get back pain too. Bad roads will be nightmare to you. Fuel efficiency is good.When you finish 1 year with Dio you will definitely come across suspension co mplaints , wobbly handle bar. If you travel alone this scooter will be awesome but with a pillion - not ok
Honda;DioBS4;3 Sep 2018;Israr Mohi;3.0; Daily Commute ;Its the R version of Honda Activa lighter, quicker, agile and stiffer

Honda;DioBS4;28 Dec 2019;Rahul Joy;4.6; Daily Commute ;It's a nimble scoot, with agile handling and a zeal to just zap around the city in traffic like it's nobody's business. Only con is the mileage though, as pulling the scoot will get you just about 30-35 kmpl.

Honda;DioBS4;22 Jan 2019;Kaushik Kr;3.4; Daily Commute ;Dio is a good scooter but honda is simply not updating their motorcycle but they r installing LED headlights,graphics,digital instrument cluster and nothing else...it has the same design,the same suspension(which is a decade old) and no disk brakes.Its too dated for this generation...Ntorq has better value and offers more!!!

RoyalEnfield;Classic350;6 Sep 2020;Kirubakaran G;3.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides;I'm 6ft1in tall. I previously own a Royal Enfield Classic 350. And let me share my experience.I'm one of the several people who fell for the looks of the motorcycle, who fell for its connect with the person who rides (possibly due to the vibrations), who fell for its low end torque, who fell for its sound.Initially it will attract you a lot and it will make you feel like a King of the Road. As you are on love with the bike, you will love its pros and love even more for its cons!Now coming to the performance it is a lazy elephant which took almost 16seconds to reach 100Kph, with a ton of vibrations. But you will love it during short rides and can't cope with after 30minutes. Because after riding over 100Kph over 30minutes, your hands will be numb and your whole body vibrates. And to come over this feeling, you need a healthy 30minutes of break. So riding under 80Kph helps but not much by a significant margin.So, let's talk about the comfort, with the stock handlebar, I've had a lot of lower back pain. With RD350 handlebar, Classic's perch is better for atleast 30 minutes if ridden sanely under 80KPH. After that, I've sharp pain in my knees due to constant vibrations from footpegs no matter the RPM you choose to ride. If ridden above 80Kph, two more pains will shoot: one from my shoulders and other from my b**t due to the vibrations it has on offer.Talking about mileage, it will provide me 33Kpl if ridden over 100Kph, 38Kpl if ridden at 80Kph, 44Kpl if ridden under 60Kph.Throttle response is lazier due to carburettor, now it is much better due to the addition of FI. Brakes are poor, front disc is less bitey and rear drun brakes are wooden (now even comes with rear disc, but still feels wooden). Ride quality is good. Tube tyres are a problem. (Tubeless is on offer today)And coming to the maintenance part, it digs a hole in your pocket during paid service. Free service costs a maximum of INR.1500. But paid service cost minimum is INR.2500. And at 24000kms, a paid service costed me around INR.10,000. People at Royal Enfield Service Centre never repairs but just replaces. It may be due to the Sub-par quality of the spare parts. So, on even years (after first year with free services) you need to allocate around INR.6000 for servicing it. And on odd years, you must pay INR.8000-10,000 for servicing. In 3years of ownership, I've spent around INR.25,000 for services alone.I've used it for 3years and ridden it for 30thousand Kilometers and finally have sold it due to heavy vibrations which causes me consistent right shoulder pain and also high maintenance it demands over years.Finally the resale value is good.Conclusion: It is pointless to buy 350cc machines from Royal Enfield today. Better opt for their 411cc or 650cc machines. If you want to buy a 350 from Enfield, wait for their J platform launch. Thank god, they bid adeu for their 500cc UCE engines. Don't commit the mistake I've once committed.Still in August 2020, this Classic 350 is their best seller. Royal Enfield doesn't want to let their milching cow, that's why they are gonna introduce the new J platform engines in their lower selling model, Thunderbird. People must change!!! For those who are in a hurry to buy a Classic or Bullet 350, Wait till J platform's lauch.

RoyalEnfield;Classic350;5 Nov 2020;Arun Arumugam;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours ;The best thing about the motorcycle is that it is not perfect and never claims to be.It is not the fastest, Nor the most powerful, Nor the cheapest and neither is it the most luxurious.It most certainly is not fuel efficient and neither is it maintenance-free.When you ride it, You are the king of the road, But when it stops, It strips you down to a donkey pulling a load thrice its own weight.It is moody.It might start within seconds despite having lain idle for the better part of a month and sometimes doesn't start even when the engine is still warm.You can't explain why it does what it does.You can't even begin to understand it.People who feel that these qualities are more endearing than irritating never move to another bike.Fact is, Its just like my brother or sister or a girlfriend(most probable option).These qualities make it more alive and more human than any other bike.This is what makes it all the more lovable.Only a person who rides a bullet understands what it really is.It teaches you life like no other bike does.I could just go on and on and on, But i guess you get the flow.‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§Ô∏è.

I have not found any issue from the time when i bought this bike. i am shocked that people say that its not good bike cannot go fast .. I know it vibrates at 80 kmph but this bike is not like others .... its not just a bike ..It is more then a bike... i saw that people compare this bike with kt m or other bikes having 300 cc engine and above , this bike is not like those bikes ... its a retro , not a racing bike. All owners think that my bike is perfect than others... i am not saying its a good bike because i own this bike.. i am astonished that people say that .... ye tezz nahi chalta hai .... and many more this bike is not made to drive fast ..... it was made to provide better riding comfort for long rides ....people think that its a 350cc bike and it cannot win race with even 200cc bike .... it is not made for racing guys ..
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;27 Jul 2020;Technophile;2.2; Tours;Royal has been familer with the tag Scam. It's a big scam. Royal dealer (Maxwheel Motors )AddressChuanpur Old Cold Storge ComplexNH 34MurshidabadBerhamporeMotorcycle shop in Baharampur, West Bengal and Royal company together working to make a big scam. They are selling old bike as a new. You will never understand in the first month. After first month will face a lot of problems like chasis problem . This is serious issue. This causes accident in any time. So my brother don't make you a victim. You have your own knowledge. Their review section marked with 5 stars are randomised and incomplete.Don't buy any kind of products of Royal Endfield. Go for JAWA it's 10 times better than Royal. If you don't believe just inspect in YouTube. Next time I will purchase JAWA or Benali for the same price. They sold me a second hand bike instead of new. Now they are not taking any action against the dealer.
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;26 Jul 2019;Mohit Mishra;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Royal Enfield classic proved to be my desire fulfilling bike. I choose royal Enfield because of its elegant design, performance, engine thump and all above its royal legacy which has been carried out for decades.Though, i had other options as well but i preferred choosing the beast over the goats. It has tremendous style possessing the macho feel as while riding u don"t feel like riding a regular one because u are on the beast. As far as performance and mileage is concerned, i can take out a 40+ average even in city traffic. The bike feels a little bulky and clutch stiffens once hands get pain in the traffic for the initial rider. So you can"t complain, because if you are complaining then it's like asking a beast to treat you gently. Hence for me, it's not a big deal. I have been using this machine for more than 22 months and rode it almost for 27,5001 km but still didn't face any breakdown even a trifle. My both hands up showing thums up after experiencing classic in all the terrains ( considering it"s not a dirt bike) and i can say if you have that skill to ride your beast effectively then it can take you anywhere. You are not the one who decides to choose the royalty,It's the royalty who decides whom to choose.So if you believe that you have that spirit, passion for the beast then you go for it. Otherwise you will die complaining like others for the heavy weight, mileage, stiff shock absorbers and clutches, less pickup and other things which doesn't matter for a true Enfielder.
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;15 May 2020;Gopi Gks;3.8; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;Dear all, Iam using classic 350 since 2015, now i changed to bs6 version, i totally satisfied to this 350 bs6 Gunmetal grey . Pros: Mileage is excellent - 44-46 on highway, 41-42 on city ( Chennai) am using this on day to day commute. My location is Kundrathur n Office is Broadway is around 37 kms , 75 kms for up and down . I checked mileage every time i fill up my tank , average is around 43 Kmpl . Maintenance: is little bit extra compared with my old one . Comfort is vary for every person, because it have some little bit vibration, bullet lovers only can feel comfortable (is my openion). Cons : engine got heat too quickly, if you want drive more than 20kms you have to wear shoes . Anyway RE classic is value for money bike .
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;1 Apr 2020;Yangxu Bhai;5.0; Daily Commute ;I love Royal Enfield and I'm fascinated by the quality, design, beating, torque, power that is offered by every Royal Enfield out there. As a matter of fact, there is no one who doesn't like Enfield bikes these days. But, my love for Royal Enfield doesn't end there, it literally flew out of the clouds and landed a desire in my heart to work for Royal Enfield.The Enfield Cycle Company is responsibl e for the design and original production of the Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history. Royal Enfield's spare parts operation was sold to Velocette in 1967, which benefitted from the arrangement for three years until their closure in early 1971.
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;3 Nov 2020;Yahya Khan;3.0; Daily Commute ;Very bad experience facing through your service centre which located at t junction dharavi sion road, Since last 2 months i am facing an issues of battery which hasn't solved by them.This is really ridiculous.Unable to ride a bike from last 15 days because of battery, Firstly they have not provided any replacement of battery, Also everyday need to follow up with them for an update by when they abl e to provide the battery, Also some part has be replace under warranty which they unable to do so because of non availability.Have purchased bike in mar 20 and facing too many issues on technical part.Its like that have made a big mistake by purchasing bullet.
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;5 Apr 2020;Saikat Mandal;3.4; Daily Commute | Tours | Occasional Commute;Hi I have bought Royal Enfield Classic 350 BS6 Stealth Black few days ago.But then I noticed that odometer reading giving an error of 100 meters at every 1KM.When I goes to a straight road about 10km long I noticed that my bike odometer shows 11 km instead of 10 km so there is an error of 100 meter of every 1km distance traveled the bike.Also bike speedometer is not correct When I ride the bike at 60 kmph I feel that the bike is actually going at 40 to 45 kmph.So this is completely blunder. I didn't think that Royal Enfield can do this to their customer. It's a shame on Royal Enfield.
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;29 Aug 2020;Naga Bhushan;2.6; Leisure Rides ;I will not recommend to buy ROYAL Enfield Classic 350 , it better to buy any other bike , because mainting this bike is equal to maintaining 2 Car, Worst Engine & Worst parts , my one is 2014 Model driven 24500km but spend more than 50000/- but still my bike is not in a good condition , giving one r the problems , main problem is Engine , Clutch , chain sprocket . Again & again you have to chainge for once in 5000km & once in 10000km need to do Engine work , if you want to own Royal Enfield you should have patience & Money , because you don‚Äôt know when it will give problems.
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;10 Mar 2020;Anand Palani..;3.4; Daily Commute ;High maintenance, running cost as well as vehicle cost. Nothing special than the look that I feel. This is been my 3 rd year with my classic 350 BS4. One simple tip for easy maintenance is to check the tight of your chain sprocket set once in every 100 km if it is loose then adjust till it gets tight and Lubrication is compulsory with any liquid lubricant not the spray. If this done the self life will be minimum 30k to 35k kms. Note: company make chain sprocket kit will be O'ring type. It won't last long. Once if it fails then prefer rolon type( without o'ring).

Very comfortable and steady. Mileage is a little less compared to my previous bike but it's k because of that heavy 350cc engine which can go faster on any surface. Maintenance is very high could be better. All of these doesn't matter, because this is the only bike which can be modified according to you r wish. What more do you want in a heavy and powerful bike like this? It's very much enough for anyone who is a Rider.

Not for high speeds just to enjoy the ride at 70-80kmph speed. For me it's okay but not great. Maintenance too high. So think before you buy. Buying a bike is not great maintaining it is the matter. I have done 30k kms. Mileage 35-38kmpl sometimes around 40kmpl. I am using only for long drive and occasional commute. For daily commute I h ave another bike.

It feels really good at 70kmph, however the vibration increases with increasing speed which is quite normal I guess. Control and breaking is great. Feels great riding on high ways and sitting position is also cool.But RE riders expects a little more top speed and power whatever the milage is I guess. For me the top is 12 0kmph, on highway you need speed right?I get some engine noise though, it seems some parts has become loose or something like that (I am not an engineer/mechanic) after 5000 kms. Also to inform after 4 years and 13000 kms the self-start isn"t working, I need to change the Kit I guess.Apart from vibration, low top speed and rusting everything is going well still now.
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;21 Aug 2020;Surendar Tejesh;3.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Riding ergonomics and comfort is spot on! But performance is worst Im not talking about acceleration or top which everyone knows, the vibrations,, it starts vibrating at 80km and goes to very annoying level at 100,, ideal cruising speed is just 70 which makes it bad for touring (the seating position is a plus but cruising speed is a minus when it comes to touring) this is good only for city commut es.

I have a field job, and this bike leaves me no back ache or tiredness, except for a clutch lever given pain in fingers of left hand. handsome mileage above 35 all roads and rides inclusive.

You can only feel it if you own it. Anyone who is looking for a good performace bike, great mileage, low maintenance bike then RE is not the cup of the tea for you. You can only enjoy it if your heart is connected with the thumping of RE. And RE is a bike which never disappoints the owner in any condition.Happy thumping guys.

RoyalEnfield;Classic350;1 Sep 2019;Jaidev Madgu..;4.6; Leisure Rides;I have owned this motorcycle since September 2019. In October, it sputtered, stopped and wouldn‚Äôt start again. It was towed to a dealership, which kept it for three days, and fixed the problem under warranty, saying it was a loose connection in the ignition setup. I was of course very disappointed that such a thing could happen to a brand new vehicle, and was ready to write off RE as an overhype d relic from the past, and bought another motorcycle. However, after the initial hiccup, this motorcycle has proven to be extremely reliable. I have taken it to rural parts of Maharashtra, where the roads are in a state of severe disrepair. The Classic 350 just trudges along without complaint. Again, because of the bad roads, I have had to ride it mostly in second and third gears. Despite this, the fuel economy is outstanding for a 350 cc motorcycle. And this is with my wife riding pillion! Riding on smooth highways is also a pleasure, as the weight of the motorcycle inspires confidence. I never go above 80 kmph, so vibrations are not an issue for me. Moreover, I have noticed that the motorcycle vibrates a lot less now that I have done two services. I have not been able to ride it for a long time now because of the pandemic lockdown. I do start it up once a week and leave it running for about 10 minutes. Every time I start it, it does up with a single kick. I must say I have a newfound respect for this timeless machine. A powerful, reliable, fuel efficient ride with killer head turning retro looks - what more can you ask for? I also feel good about riding a motorcycle that is totally made in India.
RoyalEnfield;Classic350;1 Sep 2019;Shivam Rana;2.6; Tours ;Major drawback I found out with this bike is lack of automation and engine refinement,too much vibration.RE should focus on decreasing the weight of bike atleast 20- 30 kgs.weight is too much for average person.should put leds instead of badass filament bulbs and lastly they should work on comfort level not at all comfortable for long rides.they should keep aesthetic along with high tech to be in the game.

RoyalEnfield;Classic350;20 Nov 2018;Dk Mohanty;3.8; Tours | Leisure Rides ;Nice time with my bikeBut vibration is the matter of concern
RoyalEnfield;Himalayan;9 Jul 2020;Misal Anand;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;This has to be the most value for money bike. It has great ride comfort, ergonomics and is an affordable adventure tourer. You will also enjoy this bike in daily commutes.Loads of accessories both from Royal Enfield as well as from Third Parties are available to make your experience rich. Fit the Aluminium Panniers made available by Royal Enfield and the bike becomes a head turner.Minor Negatives: Temperature Display not accurate. Tall bike for short riders - perfect for tall riders. Engine leaves you wanting for more power - but then the power to price ratio is great.If you are looking for a comfortable bike that can go anywhere and do anything, whilst not costing a bomb, then go for Royal Enfield Himalayan
RoyalEnfield;Himalayan;18 Nov 2020;Suhail Sherif;4.2; Daily Commute ;If you Maintain it,you would get bestest performance experienced by riding it.Never try to alternate the exhaust part that is most understandable reason for why you are not getting a good mileage.Do services in correct timings and if you feel any single bit of uncomfort on your bike(ie.screws or bolts get loosen up due to heavy vibration that would happen especially when you are tripping on long r ides or off-roads,some weird sound over front side of engine,abs light stays on during a ride,etc)you must get the bs4 beast to service station.Remember More you maintain the beast,the more you will love the beast to the core.!
RoyalEnfield;Himalayan;24 Aug 2020;Sayan Chakra..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;1. Superb Ergonomics. Apt for me (my height is 6ft). But definitely need an extender for Long Rides since the Wind shield will be shorter for people like me. 2. Definitely value for money. Since your servicing will be within a span of 6 months.(Excluding the first).3. In 1st Gear, I picked up a speed of 40. So I guess I will surely achieve a speed of 90-100 KMPH without any hiccups.4. Luggage frie ndly. You don't have to worry about basic luggage's which you may carry for occasional rides. ( Reach today and get back tomorrow types)I will definitely recommend Himalayan for those who wants some fresh air on weekends.
RoyalEnfield;Himalayan;30 Nov 2020;VAIBHAV MHATRE;4.2; Tours | Occasional Commute ;This is the best bike for off-road and on-road too.Very good performance.Easy controlling.I haven't met with an big accident till yet but the only thing i dislike is the parts fitted which are of very poor quality such as magnetic coil it's very weak.I have changed it 3 times in period of 4 years.Also some parts get c***k from welding itself n so needs to replace whole set.But still if you guys wa nt to enjoy your ride, On-road off-road whatever than go for r.E.Himalayan.It is the best among all.

RoyalEnfield;Himalayan;12 Aug 2020;Nandhu Sandhya;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;It's a beautiful bike. Simple, reliable, and powerful enough.

RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;20 Jul 2020;GOPIKRISHNAN B;4.6; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;I'm very happy about RE INT 650. This is my second bike. First I had a 2003 model Bajaj Caliber 115. So it was a good update for me personally. When heard about this bike I was not at all impressed and never had the plans for a RE. Because I was very disappointed about the bikes of RE without any update & also by other owners who disgustingly modifying the bike (just the new colour schemes only). Two engines and 6 models & one new engine for Himalayan. I like Himalayan but I didn't had plans to own that also. So I only loved to own a Triumph because of the brand's fit & finish and I've met so many owners & not even a single owner spoke an issue about the bike. I love classic bikes which won't show too vintage specs & want some electricals. But I was not able to afford a Triumph at that time and I usually saw 650 Twins in internet. So I just checked the specs and capabilities of this bike and I contacted RE for a test drive. First time I just rode this bike it was Mind-blowing. Why I enquired about this bike is, it almost look like a Triumph Street Twin. I'm a great fan of Street Twin. But 650 Twins lacks most electricals. It have a dual channel ABS as standard and that's it. The power delivery is very linear because it doesn't scare the rider. It can climb upto 120 easily without any hesitation. After that me personally can push upto 140KMPH after that I'm not able to push, because I don't get that much confidence for that. But it has very less vibrations compared to other REs. Whoever rode my bike in my friend circle said that whether this is a RE or what?!!. They were just impressed with the Twins. The stock exhaust is just lovely. I own a Ravishing Red colour. That's a cool colour. The touring capability is just awesome. I didn't felt any issues of backpain or burning ass. But I feel some wrist pain even after a short ride in city traffic. Don't know whether it's my riding problem or what. Because only my left wrist will get hurt after a ride. I'm working on that. No heating issues in city traffic. It's a 650CC engine and it heats as usual. But it won't affect our riding. My pillion is very comfortable in the Twins in the city traffic and I never toured with a pillion. I don't have much knowledge in Luggage carrying capacity, because I will tie a travel bag on my rear seat when traveling alone & I'm okay with that. Things I don't like in the Twins are I'm disappointed with the tube inside the tubeless tires. Triumph also have spoke wheels for their T100& T120 and runs tubeless. RE can do that in Twins but they won't. I won't ask for an alloy because spoke looks really perfect for the bike and it should run tubeless. I didn't go for any aftermarket accessories for my bike it's been a year I'm with my bike and rode around 9k KMS and waiting for the service centre to open (due to lockdown) for my 2nd service. Rust came at the connection of bend pipe to engine (both sides) and some rust like defects inside the left exhaust baffle. The fuel gauge is not accurate, you have to get used with the fuel meter because I think it may show the reading correctly after riding for almost 10-15 mins and that's not good for a bike pricing like this. The instrument cluster is very basic. RE could add a clock and gear shift indicator also, because RE Himalayan even have a compass so why don't 650 Twins have?? The front and back fendors looks metallic but it's of plastic. The bike wobble horribly at the speed between 80-90KMPH above & below this range it works just fine. Don't know why this happens because I took it to RE's ASC and they fixed it for me at first, but after 6k kms it again wobbles. You will feel the wobbling only when you release hands from the handle, but don't release handle bar fully. Just release a little and you can feel it & if you keep it steady it will go steady. These are the things I want to share about the bike. I hope I covered everything about the bike and it helps others planning for the bike. Even though I really really LOVE My INT 650 TWINS but have some suggestions to RE to make it bit more good. The issues I raised above can be fixed by the service centre itself and it doesn't bothers you much. I'm not a fan of Royal Enfield, but I'm with the 650 TWINSüòç.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;6 Sep 2019;Vishvanath G..;4.2; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;Riding my classic 350 was a great experience. I used to cruise on it and most of the times the torque, the seat the engine were all adequate. Then came the interceptor and it just took one test ride to realise what I was missing. On 27 Nov 2018 my satisfied life just turned upside down and got intercepted by the interceptor. I booked it then and there as I had no other way of achieving nirvana aga in. I booked the ravishing red colour but changed it to Orange crush as that was being delivered faster. I was told a waiting period of 120 days (and nights). Time was passing by I was riding my classic 350 as usual and having a jolly good time dreaming about my very own interceptor. You tube kept me sane as there were plethora of interceptor videos available to keep me occupied. On republic day I was going about my business as usual and I got a call from cruiser motors Dwarka that my interceptor is on its way and should reach by 27th Jan. I was pleasantly surprised and we decided that at 1400 hrs on 27 Jan,19 I will upgrade to interceptor. The PDI went well. After doing all the formalities I finally got the key at 1600 hrs. I rode it back happily. I was instructed to use only extra premium/ speed petrol and never to fill the tank to the brim. Keep tyre pressure as 32 in front and 36/39 in rear. Also not to ride the bike more than 75-80 for first 2000 kms ( lot of patience needed). I have been using it for daily 38 km commute to office and on weekend around city drives and a few tours of three to five days/1500-3000 kms. I have completed 9000 kms ( boy, have they been good!!). I have following observations -:Pros1. The bike is butter smooth. It has negligible vibrations.2. Engine delivers power in a smooth manner ( ps: its no KTM 390or even apache 300).3. Great road presence.4. Very relaxed engine ( due to low compression ratio of 1:9.5) 5. Absolutely no heat issues even in exteme bumper to bumper traffic. Just a warm breeze on your legs. It does misses on low speed in very extreme traffic and hot conditions due to engine heating.6. An all-rounder bike. Excellent on highways and quite manageable in city.Cons1. Rider footpegs have an ergonomic problem. ( It takes time to get used to).2. Tank feels a little thin to hold.( Solutions are available, keep reading to find out mine).3. Seat is absolutely pathetic. Even in city ride of 18 kms/ 30 mins it is uncomfortable. ( Got it modified from karol bagh. Added a little foam next to thighs, and got a pillion raise and guess what, My footpeg and tank issue went away to quite some extent. ( Now I can live with them).4. The clutch gap keeps increasing on its own. ( The clutch wire is touching the meters console and every time you turn the handle right it rubs and rolls resulting in automatic movement of clutch adjusting screw next to lever) FIX- tighten the screw to the max and adjust the clutch gap full and final from adjustment screws on the crank case.5. Two massive silencers keep geeting scratched especially the left one. Innocent auto walas especially do that.Service cost1. Got the first service done at 501 kms.2. Only oil change and basic checks and adjustments.3. Took four hours for service.4. Total cost : Rs 2675 only.5. Next service at 10000 or 1 year whichever happens earlier.Milleage. Overall 25 kmpl. Best 32 and worst 18.8 ( with normal fuel) otherwise 23 (with extra premium).
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;23 Jul 2020;Uppiliappan ..;4.2; Daily Commute ;Braking. Driving position is good. Standard seat is hard for long drives.Pillion seating is not comfortable because of elevated foot pegs. Heating is little bit in high city driving conditions. Suspension is bouncy making thud noise in little bad & Very bad roads . Suspension is Very Good in highways. Interceptor is definitely not a zero vibration bike. It is creating vibration in foot peg areas , Side of the fuel tank & Minor development started in handle bar area. Fuel gauge is improper/inaccurate it shows error reading we have to manually check by opening the tank. Engine RPM some times improper in idling glides up & Down.Heating in engine is tolerable it bakes our leg. in highways also. Latest happenings in my INT 650 i had problem in T-Stem i took it to the service center they replaced with , New T-Stem , Front Struts , Front Rim , Abnormal Engine noise was prevailing in my INT 650 All 8 Engine values changed on warranty . Still excessive engine noise is in my bike & bonus whistle sound intolerable. I have again informed the RE service. They assured to sort it out. The INT 650 is still a beta product . We should go to mediation course to control our patience. But riding pleasure is good. Today On 25.09.2019 my bike crossed 7000 km. The engine noise is abnormal still waiting for RE to sort our. My rear ABS is not functioning properly 60 % ineffective. Serviced the rear brake twice . Still problem. The surprise is RE is hesitating a lot change parts in warranty. It drags the issue for weeks .Pushes the customer frequent visits to workshop. RE has to sort out , Value noise & Clattering noise in INT 650. The front suspension & T-Steam is not strong enough .I have crossed 10,000 km now the engine noise is under control , in 10,000 km service . Rear brake is adjusted & Pads changed still ok only. RE is ready to change the caliper assembly if defective. Now a days RE is providing a very good service support. Now my bike has crossed 15500 km. I have now purchased extended warranty for 5th & 6th.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;9 Jul 2020;Misal Anand;3.8; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Positives: The bike has a good retro look. The headlamps have sufficient throw when dark. The engine is eager to move and is versatile - you can ride it both in a relaxed manner as well as in a sporty manner. The ride height is comfortable and getting on and off the bike is easy. The service interval is 1 year and charges are reasonable. Fit and Finish is good. Minor Negatives: The instrument clus ter is very basic - it should have had a clock and gear position indicator. The bike is heavy to move around in a parking spot. The footpegs come in way while manoeuvring the bike at low speeds or in slow moving traffic. The bike is wide with exhaust on both sides and care needs to be taken in traffic. Seat is good for short rides - not so good for long rides.Overall, it is a very balanced and well made bike. One will enjoy the ownership experience. Royal Enfield can make this bike better by bringing small upgrades such as a clock, gear shift indicator and better seats
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;4 Jul 2019;Abhinav Singh;2.2; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;I own a Interceptor (got it in December). Like most people, my bike also had issues with hard clutch and that tak tak sound since after the first service.I visited #TeknikMotorcycles Sarjapur, #Bangalore couple of times for this issue and they couldn"t fix it. Lately, clutch became too hard to even shift gears, so I called RE officials and they sent an engineer to Teknik Service center to look aft er the issue. Some friends had suggested me that it"s a clutch play issue so it can be fixed easily. But engineer said they will deliver the bike in few hours.Now it has been 6 days and my bike is still at the service center. Everyday I have to chase them to get an update and they give me shocking reason.What they told me is,Day 1: Local engineers couldn"t understand the problem so they have called engineers from the plant.Day 2: Plant engineers are checking the issue.Day 3: Plant engineers have called for a meeting and doing some R&D.Day 4: They have decided to change the original clutch parts etc.Day 5: Waiting for clutch parts to arrive from Chennai plant.Day 6 (today): They have found some abnormalities in the clutch play and connected areas in engine so they are seeking an approval to change the #Engine.Whaaaat!!! Why is that required? I don"t know if I should be worried to hear this now. They are asking for another 3 days again for more R&D and testing.I don"t understand what kind a joke is this. Royal Enfield has been promoting twins by saying that they have been working on these bikes for 10 years. I mean this is what they worked upon in 10 years?I was so happy with the bike but getting to know these things are worrying me. Cost of this bike is not less. Its just right amount for this bike. Its just the engine is powerful, otherwise quality seem to be very low.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;2 Jan 2020;Baljeet Singh;5.0; Tours | Daily Commute ;I booked intercepter 650 colour is Baker Express and as per dealer they will be able to deliver the bike in Jan 2020 end. whatever information I have gather through YouTube videos ... it's looks with minor change which need to be done after delivery.I am looking for better headlight reason being headlight isn't matching what rest of the bike is offering and I believe Thunderbird headlight would ha ve been awesome additions and seat which is not great as per the bike standards.. so looking for seat changes with better qauilty for sure.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;18 Mar 2020;Manjunath D;4.6; Daily Commute;I, am writing this review after riding my bike for last one year. I am using it regularly for going to work. It is a wonderful bike come with a awesome engine and at a great price.I like its engine mostly for its refinement and smooth power delivery. Secondly it's looks are retro. Only issue as per me is it's weight and mileage. I am getting a decent mileage of 20-23 kmpl.I am extremely satisfied about this bike. I don't feel like driving my car any more. It is a value for money bike.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;17 Dec 2019;Lalram Ngheta;4.2; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;1. It's heavy, 200kgs+ with fuel. Not so good for daily commute in heavy traffic. But that's not what I bought it for.2. Looks awesomely great. Got that retro looks and vintage charm and feel.3. Sounds awesome even with the stock exhaust. Added with aftermarket exhaust it sounds even more so.4. A great canvas for the creative minds.5. A 650 parallel twin for less than INR 3L. Grab one right now if you haven't done so yet.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;6 Oct 2020;Danesh Maximus;4.2; Tours;both 650 twins most refined royalenfileds ever. comfort I say both have a lack in seating. interceptor has narrow seat for rider which makes you crak your back after couple 100 kms, overall the motorcycle is topnotch of RE. Best for touring the engine never get tired even after miles at one streach. to end my ideas I wish 650 adv shall be build by RE as elder sibling to himalayan 400 to put a big bad adv in race.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;22 Oct 2020;Yashodhan Rege;4.6; Leisure Rides ;Amazing product from re though actually it is harris performance design under the badge of royal enfield.First ever re with zero vibration, Great balncing and smooth performance at extremely affordable price renge.I got around 25-30 kmpl during long rides.Seat is bit uncomfortable but after adding some xtra sponge it's comfortable.Super classic looks with decent performance bike suitable for daily use.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;6 Aug 2020;Tanmay Waghmare;4.6; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;Using it for past 1.5 years. Its a great bike to ride everyday! This is one of the best RE ever. Whoever wants to go for Twin engine and bigger capacity bike, This is the bike you should start with to build your dream garage! :) Till now no problem except speedo cable. This is very cost effective in terms of servicing and maintenance.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;1 Aug 2020;Satish Reddy;5.0; Tours ;Very Good Bike , The money you pay for the vehicle has value. Ride, Breaking are exceptionaly good. What I don't like is the head light which is not powerful and it should be modified. Also tail lamp they should change it to LED. Royal Enfield should come out with mag wheels for this bike.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;14 Sep 2020;Anurag Gangwar;4.6; Tours ;fantastic bike and the best value for your money.i rode 5000 km tour from mumbai to most of the southern part of country.no breakdown and even no problem i faced.Real comfort for your endurance rides.Awsome power this bike has so no problem on hilly rotes too.you will enjoy the experince.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;1 May 2019;Prabhu Patel;4.2; Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;The most refined and powerful engine till date from the RE stables. Beautiful looking classic retro styled twin engine machine. Low on vibrations and high on performance. In some ways it's a blank canvas begging to be accessorized. The aftermarkets industry must be going nuts. To be fair RE has some good accessories up for sale with the promise of more in the pipeline. On the downside are seating ergonomics (obviously subjective),placement of footpegs, pillion comfort or lack of and vendor quality control.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;2 Mar 2020;Deepam Morparia;4.2; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;Twin cylinder 650 cc bike at 3 L on road is fabulous. Very well designed bike. Yes , has few niggles like Fuel guage not reliable , doesn't have gear indicator on instrument panel etc. But for the price nothing comes close to this bike.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;9 Sep 2020;Ankit Sharma;3.8; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;A good looking machine with brilliant retro styling. Performance is nice but seat is not very comfortable. Mileage is fine. If the foot pegs position and seat comfort could be corrected it's one of the best high performance bikes.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;21 Sep 2020;Arun Subramo;4.2; Tours | Occasional Commute ;I was plaining used triumph street. Interceptor 650 performance & comfort is half the triumph street twin @ 1/3 price and that's super great . Mileage i getting 28 in 80-100kmh and 23 in120 -140 kmh.It required Alloy option
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;18 Sep 2020;A Random;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours;Everything about this bike is good. I can cruise this bike at 120KMpH easily in good road.. The Only Issue I have is Rear Shocker. Trust me It's bad. Not Ok at all. If bad road, the back is going to hurt after some time.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;23 Oct 2019;Goutham 43;4.2; Tours;ITS THE BEST LOOKING RETRO STYLED MOTORCYCLE UNDER 3L IN INDIA. ENGINE IS ITS CORE SELLING ASPECT , ITS RELAXED RIDING POSTURE MAKES CRUISING ROADS VERY EASY. OVERALL ITS THE BEST BIKE FOR DAILY COMMUTING AND LONG TOURS
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;1 Jan 2020;Wahib Nadeem;4.2; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;It's really what I expected, good engine comes with little bit of the downside toward the milage, overall performance is really great, looks could've been better but RE isn't known for their attention to details
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;21 Aug 2020;Abil Banarji;4.2; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;Bike is really good for long rides.The bad side of yhe bike is its weight and heating issue. Performance is really good but not comparable with any 650 cc bikes but with a segment of 400 cc bikes.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;23 Feb 2020;Sanjay mishra;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Leisure Rides ;Superb responsive vibration free engine.Engine sound is a melody.Handling and stability is nothing short of excellent.Brakes are awesome.Quite comfortable to ride.Fuel economy is above average.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;7 Nov 2019;Manoj Cheriyan;3.8; Occasional Commute ;Excellent engine with FE and slipper clutch. Brakes are reasonably good and has dual channel ABS. Seat is painfully uncomfortable. Footrest comes in the way when you put your feet down.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;5 Jan 2019;Hari Pratap;4.2; Daily Commute ;Interceptor should be in BS6 and speedo meter should be more aggressive and styles. Head lights should be LED lamp like Thunderbird X. Exhaust is too much wide and looking big size from the rear tyre it should be more spilit than just and should be like S&S exhaust and triumph street twin byke. Apart from that everything is very good.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;30 Jun 2020;Parth Patel;4.6; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;10,000+ km driven till now. Awesome machine. Comfortable at high speed (120+ kmph) cruising.Maintenance cost average.Tyre need to change after 10-15k Kms. Around 12-14k INR.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;24 Sep 2020;Devjyoti Raj;4.2; Tours ;its good and easy to maintain but RE plz come out with your alloys for 650 twins plzzzzzz.Over all quality is good but quality can and should be improved for its longevity.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;5 Sep 2020;Ricky Khatri;3.8; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;It's an amazing bike. Not my primary ride.. But its a fun ride to have. I love every but of it. And it gives a mileage of less than 20 but the site is not allowing me to

RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;28 Jul 2020;Avi Rock;3.4; Tours ;Overall the bike is good package in this cost but i found that to reduce the cost quality of parts are also reduced. Shockers are rigid and creating annoying sound.
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;17 Feb 2020;Antony Julius;3.8; Occasional Commute ;Overall the bike is good but having issue in starting it. Sometime couldn't hear the fuel pump sound while switching it on... Not sure why... Need some advice guys
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;30 Jun 2019;Anirban Mukh..;3.4; Tours | Leisure Rides ;Overall satisfied with the bike but have serious concern about the quality of chrome as it has already started rusting & loosing shine within less than 3 months. Another major concern is the apalling service quality, the apathy & ignorance of RE Service Centres. Do check out my short video on this topic.https://youtu.be/2AsukkLjg5Y
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;9 Aug 2020;Imtiaz Hussain;5.0; Occasional Commute ;The bike is very comfortable it takes instant pick up and is good for long drive and the main thing I have bought these bike because of it's beautiful look .
RoyalEnfield;Interceptor650;1 Sep 2020;Pranav J;5.0; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;Best one from RE . The engine is well refined and maintenance level is very less. More than enough for my needs . Its an all rounder and is easy to maintain.

RoyalEnfield;ContinentalGT650;10 Jul 2020;Johnn Quesada;4.2; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute;First bike, still learning. That been said, is a great bike with enough power to keep you entertained for long while at the same time manageable enough that it will not put you in danger if you practice appropriately. It devours the curves once you get into its agressive position, while at the same time having the right mileage and ergonomics to make it your work transport. Would like that the fue l meter was more precise, and the presence of a clock in the display, analogue would be awesome. It is not exactly cheap to maintain, as any 650cc would be, but nothing too expensive either.
RoyalEnfield;ContinentalGT650;14 Apr 2020;Abhishek Gurjar;5.0; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;A fun filled thrilling ride, its great joy at canyon carvings. Breeze on highway and easy in city rides even. A great value for money product with superior quality hardware and certainly that 650 cc twin cylinder engine is a gem. Having 25 kmpl out of most of my highway rides. Service cost is so feasible and even service period is longer compared to any other bike in its price range. In comparison with Interceptor Conti GT adds on its sporty feel. Happy Riding üòä
RoyalEnfield;ContinentalGT650;31 Dec 2018;Sandeep Singh;4.6; Occasional Commute ;Initially liked interceptor due to reviews which were shown online , I also went ahead a booked an interceptor. After few days royal Enfield called me for a test ride and I was disappointed . I was disappointed not because I did not like the machines but because I liked the gt more than the interceptor. The gt fells more planted , has better control and is a lot fun to ride. It"s gives you 500 fee l of a 650 cc . And trust me it not like an r15 but very comfortable. You can read thousand reviews but the best thing you can do is feel the beast in the flesh. Well for the booking part I have made complete payment for my continental gt 650 and on 4th will get my beast.
RoyalEnfield;ContinentalGT650;27 Dec 2019;Deepak Khanna;4.2; Daily Commute;Good value for money but think twice for long rides as being a cafe racer its amazing for city and short comutes but long rides are not comfortable as you need to take a break after atleast 50 odd kms.Amazing value for money as a city bike and an eye catcher.

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;13 Jul 2020;Msa Bawihtlung;3.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;First experience: I have been dreaming of riding a Thunderbird since the day i saw it first in 2010, and on December 2018, I finally bought a Thunderbird 350x (whimsical White) here at Enfield showroom in Aizawl, Mizoram. The staff are courteous and very helpful and they handled all the necessary documentation and even took care of insurance, registration at Transport dept. with an extra charge of a nominal amount. After 1 year and 6 months, I have covered 10,000 kms, and it has pros and cons which I will elaborate briefly.I have never owned an RE before, my previous bikes are Hero Karizma and Pulsar 220. They are smooth and fast in comparison to the RE TB 350x. And the moment I rode out of the dealer, it really turns the head, and I was in love with how smooth and easy to handle in tight traffics and corners. I love the stability of the engine at low rpm which i have not experienced in my previous bikes.. As a cruiser, it is very comfortable and contrary to its heavyweight I find it easy to maneuver in tight traffic and corners; and the fuel consumption is about the same as such of Karizma with a daily commuting distance of 26km (approx). But the power to weight ratio is low compared to my previous bikes, so that's the first disappointment. And the other problems i faced are - while riding in the rain the engine misses a lot due to which I would visit the workshop often, and after riding in the rain, the original seat gets wet for more than 3 days, so i changed it, and yes, the back bumper does not properly cover the pillion's back in the rainy season, without extra mud flap, the pillion seat gets splattered with dirt. Riding: The longest ride on this bull was 350 km straight in monsoon weather between a hilly Mizoram with lots of twisties and a plain long straight road of Assam. It was fun in twisties, but as you stretch out for a straight 40 km, you realised that the shorter handlebar is not comfortable as you need to bend a little forward with your arms straight. My arms began to ache which fathes away as soon as we reach the twisties of the Meghalaya. It was fun to ride for long-distance, and it is more fun to ride in twisties than on straight roads. In that case, the older model of Thunderbird has a better handlebar for touring. Whilst the newer X model is for those who consider a comfortable, laid-back urban riding package.And the first real problem i faced was when i filled up the entire tanky, the engine started to miss horribly. And once stuck in the traffic jam, another fellow rider suggested that I opened up the petrol tanky lid, I did and a sudden whoosh sound of air comes up from the tanky and I was able to start the engine. So, every time i face that kind of problem, I open up the tanky lid and then it works all the time. But, as it became more frequent I fixed it up at the dealer and they changed some air filter under the seat. When I asked them what might be the reason, they told me that if the tanky is filled up to the rim, these kinds of problems arise. So, I checked online, and it states that to comply with the BSIV norms, the manufacturers fit an evaporative emission control unit, which should lower the amount of fuel that is evaporated when the motorcycle is parked. In comparison to the older model, the TB X model features a redesigned grab rail that‚Äôs neatly integrated next to the pillion seat and ends in the tail-lamp unit. Although this looks quite showy and attractive, it is not at all comfortable for the pillion rider without the backrest. At first, I didn't fix the backrest, but while riding in the pillion i almost fall off backward, and on that day itself i fixed the backrest at the dealer.The new TB X use the same engine as of the previous TB model with five-speed gearbox with 346cc engine, 19.8hp and 28Nm of torque. This specifications on the Bike with kerb weight 195kg does not produce a good power to weight ratio. Forget about competing with a mere 125cc Suzuki Access, you will be smoked, except on a straight road, maybe.So, to summerise, with all the exceptions, I still love the bike. But, at its price at around Rs. 1.7-1.8 lakhs, i hope RE launch a new model with Fuel Injection with an improvement in the power. Pros:1) Stylish2) Fun and easy to ride in urban and twisties.3) Fuel consumption is not high.Cons:1) Power to weight ratio is low2) Original seat and rear mud-guard are not pragmatic in the rain.3) Handlebar is uncomfortable for touring.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;15 Feb 2019;Aniket Rajendra;2.6; Daily Commute ;Problems observed in day to day running:1.Every other day gear shifting gets hard and clutch setting needs to be done. This problem usually happens while lowering gear from 2nd to 1st.2.Fuel tank starts making noise and then service station guys adds packing to tank.3.Due to vibration, both mirrors and speedometer vibrates and makes mirror and speedometer vision blurred.4.Rear seat is very compact and not at all comfortable for passenger in behind. Forget about long drive but passenger behind can‚Äôt even sit continuously for more than an hour‚Äôs time.5.Mileage is very poor: I know there are various factors like fuel quality & driving habits on which mileage is dependent and also, I cannot expect heavy mileage of 60 - 70 kmpl in such variant. But during purchase it was informed that it gives mileage of 40 Kmpl and even in city traffic I should get min. up to 35 kmpl. But from day one I am getting is 21-22 Kmpl which is contradicts commitment.6. Handling becomes very difficult while taking sharp turn. Sales: I Got this bike on 18th October 2018.I was really happy to see bike online but had only one query whether its available in ABS to which sales executive replied ‚ÄúNO‚Äù. Since executive denied for ABS version I bought standard version and later post-delivery I understood it was available. Which means false information was shared, even if the ABS version was planned to be launched with nearby date, I should have been informed clearly so that I would have waited till it gets launched.Service:Service support needs improvement: As per periodic maintenance plan I went for 1st Service after 500 kms and the same was done but invoice copy was not given to me.During second service I requested for invoice of 1st service as well but still the same was not given and service team said they would mail me later and now I am still waiting for their mail.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;5 Mar 2020;Vinoth Kumar;1.8; Daily Commute;Such a piece of junk. Never ever go for this bike... Better avoid RE. I bought my Thunderbird 350X in 2019 October. It's been almost 1.5 yrs and hv faced lot of issues with it. 1) Silencer core broken 2) Petrol tank lid couldn't be opened, so changed the locks3) Front suspension gone, so gotta change it completely4) One way clutch is making lot of noise while trying to kick start. It's yet to be c hanged.5) The bigger chassis s***w beneath the display, gets loosened quite often, so have bought a 30-32 spanner and kept it in the pouch permanently.And lot other minor defects.When I purchased my bike in October 2018, I asked the store manager repeatedly, whether the company is gonna launch ABS version of the same, any sooner. But he denied. But within 15 days from purchase, they've released the ABS version. Such a pathetic service. So please don't waste your hard earned money on this crap.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;19 May 2020;Scotlin Nebose;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;First of all the bike is made for ride not for racing purposes As the bike was vintage cruiser itz not so fast as many bikes in the market but have a decent top speed of 120+ can attain even 130 in some long rides But remember a thing not like other bikes it can actually reach its top speed even in hilly terrain so i love the bike in the way it was made And speeking about mileage Kudos to #ROYAL E NFIELD they have made a good machine that can give an average of 37kmpl in urban traffic and gives an top mileage of upto 43 kmpl in highway cruises Comfort Even the bike weigh about little bellow 200kg(with crash guard) Its not tougher job to drive it in heavy traffic If you want to hear the drawbacksAs the bike itself was heavy If you forgot to lubricate the chain before a long drive definitely the chain will be dead by the end of trip
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;24 Sep 2020;Prakash P;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Best bike and good value for money. I will start with Mileage, highway : easy 40 kmpl and in heavy traffic it drops to 32-33 kmpl. Maintenance Cost I don't feel anything heavy for me (Using this bike for almost 10 months). Comfort wise for the rider its great and while cruising at 70-80 Km/h you don't feel vibration at all. Performance I feel a little lag with the pull (have a decent pick-up). Sty ling wise its one of the best sexiest bike that you can take. I recommend this bike if your budget falls less than 2L, if you can afford more - go ahead with Interceptor.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;14 Dec 2019;Thamim Ansari;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;As i have been using for past 8 months so I would prefer to say it fit to the person dependents on their crazes. My self i can say it‚Äôs 90% worth for money, Why because, Since it 350Cc machine and it gives 40+ milage in all kind of ride(50-110). You can drive on anywhere (OFF r On Road), i must say the Stabilisation of bike is Excellent, Until you pust it about 120km. You would feel to put more throttle when you added some louder after market Exhaust!! The looks and stile is really amazing!!
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;27 Dec 2020;Rahul Kandari;1.8; Daily Commute ;Worst re model, 350x thunderbird.Numerous of problems like never fill full fuel tank, It will start missing ignition upto fuel wents less.Metre and disc cable finishing is worst.Handle bolt loosens every 15 to 20 kms.Metre support clip breaks regularly.Front mud guard got scratches in potholes because it got touched by engine nearby area.Fuel tank air pressure issues.And many more.Never ever buy 3 50x thunderbird.

It's gradual in transition n it can take you out of any ditch or from any dirt / muck surfaces even in all stock condition. I was in all suprise after riding this road n off road ride. On road, the true Speed is 120kmph
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;4 Feb 2019;Sathya Malnad;1.8; Daily Commute ;Selfish company they don't care customers emotional They Only Need To Fill up There lockers with customers harden Money.RE people has cheated all Owners if they were launching Thunderbird 350X with ABS then why there will not launch in there earlier I brought in August 2018.Related To Service Very Pathetic Service I been experienced You even can't imagine how casual approach is in RE service centr e of their peoples slowly and gradually now people are losing trust on brand like Royal Enfield .Going forward I will not recommend to buy Royal Enfield to anyone in my group in Facebook in All Social Platform
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;4 Apr 2020;Bharat Singh;4.6; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;Back seat is small but rider seat is awesome give comfort and there is gear shift problem some times but not a big problem rest everything is the best.In City mileage is 25kmpl but when you go on highways you can get more than 50kmpl and mileage depends on your riding also i tested and got 60kmpl.I got top speed of 110km/h.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;2 Jul 2020;Sajeevkumar 3;3.4; Daily Commute ;The machine looks good, has good road presence. It has good features as well. But , it also vibrates a lot, which can be a spoiler when you travel long distances. It has a pathetic exhaust note too, very poor. Not suitable for a high speed run, it is suitable for a relaxed cruise. The sweet spot is around 70 kmph.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;19 Mar 2020;Nayan Jyoti;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;The bike is just awesome. Inspite of all rumours I hear, it delivers a very good mileage. Ride is powerful and i enjoy riding the bike. It is okay with all kind of terrains, the bike is very much stable. The only thing is it is not a sport bike, so forget about street racing and everything else is just fine.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;18 Mar 2020;Shubham Jagale;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Loved this bike Expected a few changes in riding position As it's a cruiser cruising pegs should be added And try to introduce flipped mirrors as they will look good I just had one problem with my bike and that is colour wears off too easily from my bike's handle fixture
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;29 Apr 2019;Dr Sundaram;5.0; Daily Commute ;Good bike. I have been using Bullet since 1978. I started with Lamby from Lambretta, in 1974, then Yamaha 250 D, a wounderful bike I sold off due to lack of spares and good service. Then started Enfield, Bullet 350, Electra, Thunderbird, Enfield classic 350 and now since March Thunderbird 350X. Beautiful bike in its looks and performance, If the local dealer give trust worthy service it will be a pleasure to use it. Mileage I have not checked as I am completing one month usage.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;29 Sep 2020;Adarsh Singh;5.0; Daily Commute ;Best for city rides ,best seats , best in price bike ,best in features i don't know why they don't give hazard lights but still it's gives the best in class features with anlog and digital meter and also with dual Chanel abs (best one ).
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;18 Jan 2019;Mohammed Sha..;4.2; Daily Commute ;It"s a super bike from royal Enfield thunder bird series. It is far better than old Thunderbird interms of style and comfort. But it have some manufacturing defeats. I will sort few of them,missing problem after gear changing,severe vibration,always loose the nuts tights, incorrect fuel information on meter, always loose the chain tights, not well braking discs, etc.. These are major.But it"s nice to drive. It should be a raiders choice

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;18 Dec 2018;Tanmay Verma;3.8; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;It's not a performance bike but it's better than Classic 350 and the old Thunderbird 350, would not recommend to those who need explosion power. There are vibrations but they won't bother you after a week or two. It's comfortable and easy to maneuver. The alloy wheels and tubeless tyres gives better control and confidence even when leaning for a turn at high speed.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;17 Dec 2019;Shubham Singh;3.8; Daily Commute ;Performance is nice. But has some cons, like clutch doesn‚Äôt free the completely. You have put extra effort to move the bike when it‚Äôs in gear, after pressing the clutch completely.

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;9 Feb 2019;Shreyash Ishaan;3.4; Daily Commute ;Amazing bike. Just not for me. I personally need more power for my riding style. It almost meets requirements power wise on daily commute but the moment you get an empty road, you feel the lack of it. Brakes even if much better than before, could be much better. The weight leads to skids upon hard application of only the back one.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350X;2 Oct 2019;Shubham Arora;4.6; Occasional Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;I bough this bike recently. Drive is very good. Comfortable for long rides. Vibrations are there. However, if you maintain good gear ratios, you will enjoy the calmness.

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird500X;3 Nov 2019;Mahendar Cha..;4.6; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;I bought RE TB 500X Orange on 25th Oct 2019. Drove 300 plus Kms in a week. Excellent styling, comfort and torque. One must buy a 500X over 350X to get the max thrill and motorcycling experience out of this class offered by RE. The weight to power ratio is 0.75 CC per kg higher for 500X than 350X. Value for money for bike enthusiasts. My little experience tells me that this bike this bike will requ ire attention and care / regular maintenance checks, to optimise high performance. But this stands true for all heavy bikes above 300 CC. The new handle bar adds to riding experience, but you need little rest after 120 km on a stretch, as it strains your back. Pick up and torque are true to RE spirit for 500X, offering higher torque at low RPMs. GO for it, you will love this machine!
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird500X;3 Sep 2019;Mukesh M;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;it's been a week since I got the vehicle, so far it's a beast with new costume. simple and elegant seating,ready to capture long distances attitude, instant power and thump whenever we rev, all of it makes me find a reason to got on to bike more often.Totally worth cruiser
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird500X;31 Mar 2019;Capt;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Although it weighs 197 kgs, i found it much lighter to handle as against classic 350. Bucket seat and ergonomics are the two key factors. Comfortable - it takes a couple of days to get used to bucket seat after classic 350 habituated posture and it also depends on the height of the person. It is s beauty.

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird500X;22 Feb 2020;Sudipta Hazra;4.6; Daily Commute;It is a wonderful experience to own a Thunderbird 500x. It is the most practical bike from Royal Enfield, as there is alloy wheels, less vibration,powerful headlamp. It is almost fully rectified version of all the RE bikes. But top speed of the bike is quite low. With 500cc engine capacity it only touches 120kmph whereas Himalayan can reach 145kmph with 411cc engine capacity. Very poor performance in terms of swiftness. Otherwise it is the very best product even better than Interceptor or Continental GT, because in both of them pillion riders feel uncomfortable as there are twin silencers.

RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;13 Jan 2020;Subhamoy Cha..;5.0; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Have not been regular with riding last two years as I have been out of home due work. But the rides I have done has been issueless. Apart from weekend rides, I have made a trip to Leh, transporting my bike from Calcutta to Chandigarh by road, and same way back, riding the rest. It's a bike which I found very stable on the worst of roads. No issues anywhere, as compared to the many problems with my partners. But what I understand, and what I believe is, biking or even driving, needs a finesse which most of the experienced riders/drivers lack. If you live your bike or car, which all men do, then show the love not by cleaning and polishing it everyday, but by riding or driving technically in the correct manner. Keep the machine healthy from inside, and your vehicle will never let you down. We started from Leh, back to Manali, no petrol pump for the next 300 KMS. By evening, all were sweating, their fuel indicators not even moving and stuck at the E symbol, and yet to reach the next petrol pump another about 30 KMS, the first one since we started. It was only me who was laughing on all, as my tank still indicated half tank. All opened the tank to check levels, had their theories of wrong indication. But at the pump, my bike actually took petrol just more than half to to up. All during the ride I had tried to tell everyone about riding correctly, technically, understand the engine limitations, follow the recommended procedures and not apply self created theories, to which no one listened, but the last return paid off my tips, at least to me, and set the example for my friends. I love my bike, the Himalayan, though people have their grudges about it. I do agree though, the quality of the materials used to make the bike could have been better, but again to keep such a competitive price for such a machine must have been a challenge for the company.
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;14 Jan 2020;Ashish Joshi;3.8; Daily Commute | Tours ;good bike for touring.average is decent.however RE needs to work on many things for improving the1overall riding experience,noted some of them as below,seating posture,vehicle is heating too much in traffic standing positions,more information to be provided on display,especially when bike is designed1for touring GPS, Bluetooth, call taking facility, sms reader etc can be added,mobile charging faci lity to1be added,one more gear also can be added, rear mirrors are too small,seats of the bike are very1bad.I have changed the same,also no custom designed accessories are not readily available in your1showroom,your workshop mechanics are not able to handle the technicality of the bike,very bad service at1RE workshop,look into the same,but let me tell you with all the upgrades done by me the bike is1fantastic,good torque, smooth engine, no vibration, road stability, heavy running capacity...
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;27 Aug 2019;Gokul Rajan;1.4; Occasional Commute ;My RE Himalayan"s mileage is 12kmpl and max speed is around 100km/h .Don't buy as there is no power or mileage max speed is 95-100km/h, above 95km/h the vehicle gets too much vibration which we cant handle. Problems of bike is the following 1.Low Mileage 12kmpl, 2.Top Speed90-100km/h, 3.Air vent in the petrol tank had problem,so during rain every time water gets into the tank. From the first serv ice i have been reporting this to the RE showroom staff & each time they would say by next service it will be OK . No mileage or NO Top speed also no proper service . I gave complaints and the reply was "just take to showroom you have purchased". So as they i took to the RE Showroom service and i told the problems but they did nothing. Also they won't write down every problems we say to list down in the service chart, they just write 3 or 4 things only Why should you buy a bike giving 100km/h max speed with 12kmpl mileage costing near 2 lakhs .
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;15 Nov 2019;Varun Purava..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;Best adventure touring bike below 2 L in India. Mine is 2018 non ABS version of snow white and I've covered over 15 k km with my Himalayan. Off road ride is like whole another level of awesomeness with this bike. During the free service period each service costs around only 1000 rs. Ease of handling in city is too good. I get mileage of 36-40 in highways and 30-35 in city + highways and around 28 in city use. I'm 6 feet tall and its sitting posture is very good. Standing and riding is too easy if you want to stretch your legs. Note : If you are not getting above 30 mileage then check these things regularly- 1. Tyre pressure.2. Use clutch only when needed.3. Do not accelerate like a racing bike. It's not. Its's a RE bike.4. Best speed range for Himalayan is 60-80 km/hr.
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;26 Aug 2019;Kikkawa Vint;3.0; Daily Commute ;I Bought the BS4 Himalayan ABS three months ago. I usually do 25km ride daily. The bike started showing problems just after one month of purchase. The head assembly was changed due to Engine noise problem. Fuel Blockage issues started after that and still not solved even after taking the bike to the service center for more than six times. The Fuel meter is not 100% reliable. The clutch, gear Box a ssembly, Engine needs a lot of refinement. The Himalayan is a motorcycle with large potential in its segment, but reliability is poor. Note: If someone wants to buy the upcoming BS6 model, I suggest them to wait for an year after the launch of the bike, just to ensure if the bike shows any problems.
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;24 Feb 2020;Mihir Ketkar;3.4; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Be patient for the first 2000 kms since that is the breakin period. I would recommend you change the engine oil to Motul 5100 semi synthetic around 2000 kms, this will reduce vibrations drastically and increase your mileage. I get an average of around 35 on the highway and 25 in the city post the oil change. If you are thinking of buying for performance than please don't buy this bike since it wil l get you to 80 quickly and fizzle out by 100. My height is 185 cms and this bike is not comfortable for my height but it is better than any other bike in this segment. Rest everything is great.
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;29 Feb 2020;Abhishek Mishra;4.6; Tours | Leisure Rides;I have taken the Himalayan twice to Leh Ladakh, believe me it's the most comfortable bike, good pick up. Best part you can easily come out in sludge, water, no roads, bumps. The only things is that it's seat is quite high but I am 6 feet tall. I have seen other RE bikes struggling in getting out from heavy damaged road highly muddy sluged road. Himalayan was quite comfortable. And it's also depend upon the rider. The most important or demerit that one has to keep in his mind is that the brakes gets fails once disk pads gets extreme hot.

Looks dashing on road, people literally stare at you. I have done quite a few modifications on it like guards, panniers, handle bars and it looks awesome. Have done quite offroading since I bought it, and it just goes anywhere you want. Riding in a metro city is a problem due to heating issues bu t I usually take it out on weekends for rides so not an issue for me. Go for it.
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;4 Nov 2019;Nishant Rampal;4.2; Tours | Leisure Rides ;It is an adventure tourer multipurpose bike that handles decently on the highways and amazingly good at off road/ bad terrain. I have never faced issues with riding at 135 kmph very stable if see its category of 411cc displacement. Very comfortable at high speed and even in the cites. The best place where it shines is when riding it on offbeat places. You do feel it should have more power on highw ays but to be honest it does not k**l your hope you can live with it.

There is always unavailability of spare parts , accessories in the dealerships. They always have a answer that the bike has no demand in that particular region that's the reason why they don't have the parts or spares . The service is very poor and they don't know how to handle a customer . Poor accountability .Poor service . I still have the regret that I have chose Himalayan to Dominar
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;21 Sep 2019;Om Czc;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours;Love it. Hate It.

RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;2 Apr 2019;David Jeba;3.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;a great bike from RE stable.I hated RE for its vibrations. Himalayan is super powerful and smooth in 80-140kmph range I wish there is a carbon fibre version of Himalayan. in off-road conditions the bike has to be in manageable weight. Himalayan is monstrously heavy. clutch is hard radiator is a joke. need a bigger radiator tubeless tyres is the most missing options always on headlight is not a sma rt thing. should have had a smaller led day light 5inch shorter height would have been ideal
RoyalEnfield;HimalayanBS4;25 Dec 2019;Tejas Bhosale;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours ;I know when you take such bikes mileage should not be the problem, but seriously carrying fuel in a container for this is not worth, I'm not talking about leh or spiti.

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;24 Aug 2020;Ananya Vasudev;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;This is a critical review . This review involves about the bike, rider and the mechanic.The Bike is good. It is excellent and easy to handle even in city traffic. The Showroom Aadith Motors Mysore was not much responsive and the service manager had shown utter irresponsibility during the delivery. The CLAMP BETWEEN CARBURETOR AND ENGINE WAS MISSING. Which would have got separated during the ride. No wash, No Polish, not even a word SORRY. Remember you have paid Rs 1,93,000 . There was a scratch on saree guard. I refused the delivery and next week the showroom delivered my bike with solving the above issue. The speedometer console fills with moisture during rainfall and it affects the display and ultimately you loose your display. I got it replaced within 4 months. Now i have a plastic cap over it which is transparent and available on Amazon.The Royal Enfield which has Liquid Gun Semi Synthetic Oil is the worst one which I have seen. It turns black within 500 kms if you are not a regular rider and turns black for 3000 kms . The company says to use it upto 6 months or 10000 kms. But ultimately it is your engine which will get spoiled. Hence change the oil for 3000 kms or 6 months. Post warranty of 2 years pls go for MOTUL Synthetic Engine Oil. It is always better. I have opted for Extended warranty as there is no local mechanic who deals with enfield at my place and unfortunately i am dependent on these chaps. Some tips:-Clean and Lubricate the chain once in 300 kmsDry wash as for as possible. If it is really necessary then go for a detailed washBetter to go for vinyl coating for tanks. 3M is better in that case . This avoids the scratches. It is worth too. To be frank I really love the bike. Not even a single day I had an issue on road. It wont VIBRATE. It is a beast. Annually if you have a showroom maintenance including chain l**e for 300 kms you will have to spend around 6000. If you use synthetic oil then you get the service done based on kms not based on time.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;24 Sep 2019;Subash Rai;5.0; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;FloksI had been riding this bike since I purchased and it"s good for longer trip especially to the hills, I always enjoy going on this for longer trips and main advantage of this bike is its sitting posture which will reduce your back pain comparing other bikes.It"s extra large fuel tank will give you 650 to 700 kms continuous ride without refueling. Its weight of 190 kgs will give you firm grip e ven if you will exceed above 100 speed only thing is you have to modify your handle bar a little bit to reduce the vibration but I am ok with it I want to feel like I am riding on a wild bull and make sure your bike is maintained well every 3 months interval. Always know this every bike has pros & cons ,my suggestions to TB 350 Lovers please don"t get carried away by few negative feeds.It"s totally upon you how you will deal with this machine and see how it will respond.Every bike is made for their own purposes and TB-350 is Cruising Bike and definitely it"s not made for sporting.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;16 Feb 2019;Aditya Nalawade;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Daily commute- Comfortable,Easy to maneuver, good turning radius, All goodies are packed inside even for daily commuteTouring-Tank range is huge as it has 21litres fuel tank.Engine doesn"t heat up,can tour all day long widout any issues.Great provision for saddle just pull out a cable remove pillion seat and you are ready to go.Pillion seat comfort is kind of good.Only issue is the seat which bit hardPerformance-Well it"s a air cooled,long stroke,cruiser. Cruiser has a good midrange and this bike has it. Take a corner and it will surprise you until you are scraping footpegs all over. Vibration will start creeping at speeds over 90 kmph but if you opt for semi synthetic oil or synthetic man it makes a hell lot of difference.Maintenance-Easy on pocket,You have to replace speedometer bracket atleast once.Fuel gauge is just for decorative purpose never depend on it.Suggestions-Try Semi-synthetic, Synthetic oils, never push it for offroading
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;13 Nov 2019;Adhyatm Dixit;2.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;bike is nice for a nostalgic value, performance wise its not up there, too heavy and breaking isn't great even with the disk breaks. acceleration and mileage both take a hit due to its weight. The bike is not comfortable at all for long trips with its sitting and leg positions. Its definitely not a cruiser. It gives bad back pains during long rides. Most frustrating with it is the engine noise. ev en after being so expensive , the engine noise makes it less appealing. And also less refined.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;24 Sep 2020;Laxmikant Pa..;3.8; Daily Commute ;The bike lookwise is a very stylish and trendy bike. The bike's braking is awesome, i just love it.but the bike is not as good as royal enfield because it has some problems that I am facing like, its engine leaks oil, i don't know why?The bike clutch is very tight that clutch wire may break every 3 to 4 months.I have both disk brakes but its rear disk bake not working properly.It has very expensiv e maintenance, almost 2800 per maintenance session form the company ofcourse.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;23 Sep 2020;Basab Bagchi;3.8; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;This bike is great on comfort, even the mileage is great for a 350cc engine. But it needs pretty minute maintenance especially for the chains, the front suspension, the meter casing, the switches and the clutch lever. Performance is also good but the engine feels happy to cruise a 60-70 kmph and not good for sudden overtakes. Being very heavy also means you have to be careful while handling it but it has pretty good road grip.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;5 Dec 2019;Dharitri Devi;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours;Very good bike looks great handles well. I am using it for more than 2yrs and i am getting a mileage of135km/l. It is a bit heavy at city but you will really enjoy on the higjways. Bt the only problem is that after1crossing 80 the bike vibrates a lot and it doest want to go after 110km/h. My top speed is 120km/h. If you want to cruise at 60 70 speeds thunderbird is definitely for you
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;24 Nov 2020;Rahul Kumar;1.8; Daily Commute;RE is a milestone among indian bikes lovers specially bullet but till mid 2020. RE has not updated themselves to compete with other market leaders. and moreover that service centres are filled with big frauds ediots and unlearned technicians and executives. they mostly insists on spare parts changing and that also with one more new issue left in the bike. totally waste of money
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;21 Aug 2020;Navojit Roy;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;The model is good for a single rider. With pillion is slightly sluggish. A higher cc say 500 one would be great for those who tend to ride with pillion most of the times. Otherwise this is an excellent bike. Treat it like a member of your family, give it due respect and care. It will give back the care given to it and vice-versa. :) :)
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;24 Jun 2020;Vijay Kishore;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;I commute to office daily in my Royal Enfield Thunderbird 350.

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;11 Oct 2020;Pain Nagato;1.8; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;I of biggest mistake was buying this motorcycle. This was my first royal Enfield and my last royal Enfield.

Now I am looking to sell this big piece of junk.
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird350;26 Jul 2020;Rohit Chawla;3.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;This is a wonderful bike, pretty comfortable in this range of motorcycle, but as they say there's always scope for improvement and the quality of the parts used in the whole bike should be improved as the life span is pretty short for this kind of machine.

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird500;7 Jul 2019;Rashmin Bhagwat;2.2; Daily Commute ;Owned and using TB500 since March2016. Average 20kms/day...48000kms approx done. Buying and servicing experiences were good. But the performance of the bike is TERRIBLE. Brand new and within 4 months had to replace the fuel pump(costs Rs.15000 !!!)...fortunately it was covered in the 1year warranty and I was saved. The front mud guard is a joke...its there only for show, but doesnt do what its sup posed to... Bike runs over a small water patch and you have water sprayed on both your feet. Imagine the scene in the rainy season...your trouser legs as well as shirt front are covered in muddy spray which doesnt wash off easily....Rear mud-guard also does a good job of spraying the back of the person riding with you... I wonder what kind of donkeys RE have in their design department who think only about looks and appeal, but not a thought given to utility and well being of the rider. Also, within 1st year I had to replace Ignition assembly as the ignition switch shorted out because of rain water entry !!!...lots of other bikes around from different companies...they dont get shorted ignition switches. But TB500 does !!!....replaced fuel gauge (TWICE !)...bcoz it just keeps showing wrong level...after 2nd replacement I gave up bcoz it still shows the wrong levels...,and in the next year the chain sprocket assembly, handle fork cone-set, brake pads (twice),...and about 4months ago, in March2019 the bike just shut off in mid-ride...went dead !!!... RSA technician managed to burn my wiring while checking the fuse box, and there was a battery death due to 2weeks(!!???!!) bike inactivity when I was out for a holiday in May2019, and yesterday morning (6July2019) the same thing like 4months ago happened...bike just went dead in mid-ride. Red ignition switch dead !!!...self-start or kick start doesnt work...currently at service center awaiting problem diagnosis from service advisor.I had TVS Victor GL for 12years until 2016,...she was a gem...never troubled me once for first 7years!!!...just change oil on time and she was good...neither my daughter"s TVS Wego troubled me since 2010. These were cheaper, less powerful, non-premium bikes...but no hassles...and TB500??...2lakhs in 2016 and just look at the headache I brought home !!!I have decided to sell it off asap...just not sure whether to go for another RE model...bcoz their spares quality doesnt seem to be much, considering the amount of replacements I"ve had to make. If you"re thinking of buying TB500 then think 10times, and be ready to shell out a lot for maintenance, not to mention the headache and irritation !!! STAY AWAY !!!
RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird500;26 Aug 2019;Prashant Jha;3.0; Tours | Leisure Rides ;It is a great highway cruiser but a pain when driving in the city. It has a powerful 500cc engine which is good. But the vibrations, lack of latest technology are some negatives. Overall its a good bike if you like cruisers and especially the RE bikes with a thump then this one is definitely for you. if not then dont buy it,

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird500;27 Sep 2020;Suhas Rao;3.4; Daily Commute ;Love the bike, but couldn't find the mileage, i found a oil leaking always from engine, maintenance cost is heavy the spares are too expensive.

RoyalEnfield;Thunderbird500;19 Apr 2019;Subhash Nair;1.8; Leisure Rides ;It"s a high maintenance 2 wheeler, with very low fuel average, good only for long drive, if you can pay continuously for maintenance and fuel, engine gets too hot, altogether not a good bike for City.

RoyalEnfield;Classic500;8 Sep 2019;JITENDER YADAV;3.4; Leisure Rides ;BIKE IS GOOD TILL THERE IS NO TROUBLE BUT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE AN ISSUE, MOST OFTEN THE DEALERS ARE NOT ABLE TO ADDRESS IT IN ONE GO AND REQUIRES MULTIPLE VISITS WITH BELOW AVERAGE EXPERTISE LEVEL. COMPANY RESPONSE TO CUSTOMER CARE IS POOR AND MOST OFTEN THEY ARE IN SUPPORT OF THERE DEALERS ONLY AND YOU ARE MADE TO GO BACK TO THE DEALER ONLY IN SPITE OF REPEATED REQUESTS FOR A CHANGE OF DEALER DUE TO POOR WORKMANSHIP AND EXPERTISE. THE BIKE IS CERTAINLY NOT TROUBLE FREE WITH HIGH VIBRATION LEVELS BUT IT MORE THAN COMPENSATES FOR WITH HIGH TORQUE AND GOOD ACCELERATION.
RoyalEnfield;Classic500;16 Jan 2020;Praveen Kallat;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;It is the best retro bike and this colour is loved by everyone. Personally I also own a classic 350 gunmetal grey and I have done regular 1200 kms ride in 11 hours from chennai to palakkad and back frequently. It is a value for money bike and good for commuting touring and also a little bit of offroading. Like people says it can take you places with roads or without roads 35 to 36 kmpl is decent m ileage for a 500 cc single cylinder mill
RoyalEnfield;Classic500;23 Feb 2019;Gaurav Parker;4.2; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Stylish design and thump is awesome. But this bike vibrates too much after 80 km/ hr. Even i use motul 5100 still its uncomfortable. Build quality of bike is going down day by day. Welding joints are not cleaned properly and directly painted. Chrome parts get rusty. To get optimum comfort one need to change handle bar seats. RE service centre charge you unnecessary for unwanted spare parts. I am u sing this bike for past 5 years and mileage never goes below 32kmpl. On bombay goa road via pune i got 43kmpl average. It depends on your riding style. If you run always above 100 then petrol consumption is rapid. Maintain speen between 60 to 90 on fifth gear. Its awesome bike on of my best buy but company is just making money by selling cheap quality product.
RoyalEnfield;Classic500;25 Mar 2019;Mohamed Shafeeq;2.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;The quality of the vehicle is very cheap. The vibration from the engine makes it really uncomfortable to1drive. Infact, i am planning on selling the bike which has just run 6500kms. The maintenance cost is too high.The fuel pump is a failure for bs4 models and frequently gets damaged on its own. But, for that replacement,i should pay around 9000rs. I had already paid 2 times. So, i am planning on selling the bike. I waited around 41years for getting the desert storm. But, all the dreams that i had during the 4 years has shattered now. This is the last time i am buying an RE.
RoyalEnfield;Classic500;27 Dec 2019;Sathish Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute ;Pros -King of the roads, comfortable, eye catchingGreat pride to own a 2.7laks vehicle. Durable, manly looking. Dream come true vehicle.Cons-Service dealership should be upgraded. more service centers needed. Radiator should be fitted for reducing heat of the beast 500cc engine. Tech team should look upon it
RoyalEnfield;Classic500;24 Dec 2018;Pradeep Mishra;2.6; Daily Commute ;I bought the bike in 2014. Had good experience till 2016. Thereafter i started to come across problems one by one. Authorised service centre is pathetic with incompetent and untrained staff having poor understanding of the bike and defect. Off late i have been facing the problem of starting the engine. They recommended to change the battery so i did. After sometime, they asked to change a lot of c omponents and now ECU unit. Still problem persist. Royal enfield has failed to provide satisfactory solution and i am living with the problem. Planning to dump the bike.
RoyalEnfield;Classic500;27 Jan 2019;Shivkumar Ch..;4.2; Leisure Rides ;Riding experience with the bike so far has been very good . Its a good mile muncher with lots of reserve power for hiway overtaking manoeuvres. The weak area is service support. service support is at Manjunatha Garage Banaswadi , Bangalore . But in all service centres always noticed that mechanics don‚Äôt mount split pins . Mechanics are not aware of the importance of split pins and self locking n uts . Mileage ranges between 20 and 30 kms, deprnding in riding habits . Stick to 90 kms speed , except while overtaking , and highway mileage improves dramatically ..
RoyalEnfield;Classic500;22 Mar 2019;Bipin E;2.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Riding is comfortable, Performance is also good but Every 15000 kilometers 13000 Inr expenses for buying parts. Chain & sprocket 2000 Inr Rear Tyre-3500 Inr MRF 120/80/18Brake shoe-253*3=760 Inr change every 5000 kilometres. Oil Change-1700*3=5100 Inr change every 5000 kilometres. Motul 15w50 oil 3litres at each change + oil filter one each at every oil change Inr80*3.Above that Clutch Cable Inr 1 00 & Accelerator Cable 244 Inr one each. Battery will last only for one year so every year new exide battery adds another 1500 Inr. Mechanics labour charges extra.

RoyalEnfield;ContinentalGT;4 Jun 2020;Pruthvi Rajdev;3.8; Leisure Rides ;It's a cafe racer, I've even modified it to do so more. its not comfortable and has a lot of issues, especially electrical. On the other hand, it rides like nothing else, and you get lost in the smooth power delivery and loud exhaust notes, and the chassis is really stiff, so throwing yourself in corners feels so natural that even if you've never leaned, it will make you lean in to the corner. it' s ride height is adjustable thanks to Paiolli springs and you can adjust for perfect rides through any roads!

Just the one that I always wanted but the only problem that I came across was the different types of mechanical issues in the bike. These issues were so different that you would be surprised every time you get into any problems. However, I still Love my Bike.
Yamaha;YZFR15V3;9 Oct 2020;Arjun kaul;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Having a bike was a childhood dream for me. I spent over 3 months researching all the available bikes in India before finally choosing the Yamaha R15. From the moment I saw the bike I could sense there was something very special about it. Not just its excellent looks but also it's brilliant performance. From the YouTube videos of various riders demonstrating the R15 I could tell that it's an 'Exce ptional' Bike. I took a test ride and was really impressed with it. Before that I had an opportunity to also ride the KTM RC200. I preferred the R15 over all other bikes in the 150-200cc set. I will now present all my findings having done over a 1100km on this bike in just under a month. The engine and performance is excellent. Perfection. Great pickup, smooth transmission, easy gear shifts, good braking and tons of power if needed. This bike is deceptively fast. I just want to mention I like to keep at very safe speeds. I remember recently i was cruising at about 60 in the city and the road had less traffic so I decided to throttle it just a little. Within seconds I looked at the speedo and it was at 110kmph. It's surely a top end monster. It is as smooth at 60kmph as it's at 100+. Zero engine strain. The mileage I got from the bike brand new with no service was 58kmpl. That's pretty unbelievable for a bike with this kind of performance. That surely indicates great engineering. The looks of this bike stand out in a big way. Very elegant and good looking design. Classic lines. I can see people staring at it at intersections. The bike gets compliments all the time. The bike off roads surprisingly well too. I took it to Damdam lake and I could take it through the steep dirt tracks to the lakeside without a problem. The riding posture is aggressive and I personally love it. It's feels great to ride this bike. The key is to keep your arms and wrists relaxed and use your legs to grip the tank and thus distribute your body weight off your upper body. This is actually the recommended way of riding ALL kinds of bikes as per riding instructors. Since I got the bike I don't drive my car much anymore. That's how much fun this is. That too with Indian traffic and weather which can be challenging at times. I have already toured a little on this bike having done about 1000km going on road trips riding many hours at a stretch. No problems to report at all. A true winner. Buy with confidence. I will recommend that you get all the accessories as well, like crash guards etc. They all are very good for your bike and help keep it safe. Special thanks to Yamaha JM Motors Noida for their great support throughout the buying experience. They worked fully throughout the peak of the pandemic. I hope that you found this review useful. Please do follow me on YouTube. My name is Arjun Kaul aka Lord. Stay safe and happy riding)
Yamaha;YZFR15V3;4 Aug 2020;Ashwashil La..;3.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;I have bought the bike on 20th of march in cash and on the same day i realize that the meter's button were not working. So i concern with the dealer with the issue he then changed the meter. Now as their was lockdown in india i was not able to ride my bike. But in may month i move to my native town amravti from pune where i realize that their is again a issue in the meter as it was not showing pro per speed. Now meanwhile i have to take my bike to servicing but their is no authorized dealer in my hometown and i have to go more than 100km to visit the yamaha showroom for servicing and to resolve my meter problem. Now when i call the yamaha india they are saying that when you will visit the showroom than and only than we can tell you about the meter waranty and will it be replaced or not.So my humble request to everyone is that please make sure that you check every part of your yamaha bike before you purchase of the bike if it is not proper than pelase replace the bike at the first place at the first purchase or else you be in big trouble like me as i have to now stumble upon.Because yamaha as per my experience will not compensate to your issue. My first servicing voucher is gone as i was following goverment rules and also if warranty of my meter is gone i have to also pay for it to, after purchasing incash yamaha bike.

Yamaha;YZFR15V3;21 Dec 2019;Marc Thomas;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Since its launch in 2008, I became a BIG fan of this bike in my childhood. After watching it evolving through time to time, as I got my license, I decided to buy this 150cc maniac.There's no denying fact that this 150cc perfoms just like a 200cc machine. It's screaming power output and aerodynamics, it made me reach over 150kms of top speed, just like a moderate 200cc bikes did.There's no word 'co mfort' in it. It's aggressively positioned, which I prefer for the best handling at corners and speed. Console and engine are two precious gems embedded on it.Mileage is bonkers! Once I got 52kmpl, can't believe this!? Pillion seat height is not that high and refinement is still there as it used to have since 2008.I prefer this 150cc machine over 200cc because you get more mileage, which is the strongest issue in the motorcycle market of India, and its refined, its friendly natured..... Until you go past 9k RPM

Yamaha;YZFR15V3;18 Mar 2020;Pranav Anand;4.6; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;I bought my FAVOURITE R15 V3 in May 2019 from a showroom located in Sohna Road, Gurgaon. It is a comfortable ride for sports bike enthusiasts. Unfortunately, it lags comfort and the co-passenger might feel discomfort during long rides. It is not suitable for a common man looking for a family two-wheeler.Nonetheless, it is an apt riding motorcycle for a single rider. One of the key advantages that one can benefit from riding this motorcycle is that it corrects the posture of the rider. So, a ride won't face back issues. Although, long rides are still not suitable for this motorbike. You can ride it comfortably by slightly bending elbows and bending the back like a sports rider.
Yamaha;YZFR15V3;6 Oct 2020;Danesh Maximus;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides;r15v3 bs6 in my opinion worths more than the cost paid. ASC with dual channel abs not even in ktm 200 twins and bajaj 200 twins. around 1.8laksh INR Price tag with 18.5 ps power the r15v3 is really an amazing motorcycle for all kind of riders and also the best entry level track machine. I loved the vehicle in city commute and weekend rides. Best in class and best for your money spent. the build qu ality it's really compro. ised by yamaha it should be taken care of. the gaps in panels and some ratteling noise really sucks. but the look carried frm elder sibling r6 stands on its own way.
Yamaha;YZFR15V3;10 Aug 2020;Aravind MC;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Pros 1. Good Mileage - City (50 km/ltr), Highway (50 - 53 km/ltr)2. Top Speed (I achieved) - 144 kmph3. Low maintenance 4. Great control while cornering even at 100+ kmph5. Well refined engine and good brakes Cons1. Don't even think about the off-road drive 2. Headlight visibility is good only with the high beam on. Light throw is poor. Zero visibility at the corners.3. Solo ride will be good. Bec ause if you have a pillion even the small pressure they give on you will affect you very much.
Yamaha;YZFR15V3;25 Nov 2019;Vasim Shaikh;4.6; Daily Commute ;1. Have purchased dark knight edition in August 2019.2. Mileage part is awesome. Since i ride in Mumbai city I get a mileage of 40-45.3. First service done. Make sure you do not got full tank petrol. It may affect mileage.4. Who ever is having back or neck ache, check out correct riding posture for sport bike. Hold the tank with your laps and keep the pressure away from shoulder and palm to avoid pain.5.During rainy season you would need to get an additional tyre hugger to avoid getting mud all over your legs or pillion 6.

Actually the main thing I love the control of this bike and engine sound when you reach above 80 kmpl it's sounds like a beast and even you go upto 157 to 160 kmpl on this bike. Another thing is ri ding comfortable and I never get bored riding the Yamaha R15 V3.

Yamaha;YZFR15V3;4 Jun 2020;Maninder Singh;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;I have owned this bike for about a year and I have very little to complain about. Mileage is more than I could ask for from a sport 150cc, the clutch is light not being harsh on your hands and a perfect beginner bike overall. And if you ever get underwhelmed by the power there's plenty you can do to make up for it! Only complains about the seating posture which gets to your back on long rides.
Yamaha;YZFR15V3;22 Aug 2020;PR7 Vlogs;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Yamaha R15 is a great beginner bike if you are looking to get into the world of sport bikes or stunt riding. In the city, It is a very nimble and easily flick-able bike that gets you effortlessly through practically any gap in traffic. On the highway, you can maintain a comfortable speed of 70-80 kmph. Moreover the mileage is not bad at all for a sports bike that I use as a daily.

If some one keeps this bike even for an year i can guarantee that user will not be disappointed with anything. I agree that this bike is expensive if you compare it with other available options in the market, But this bike is value for money in 1.65 Lac. Resale is also very good if you sell it after 2 to 3 Years.

If you know how to ride a bike like this, you wont get any wrist or back pain. Service and maintenance cost is low compared to other brands.

Yamaha;MT15;4 Oct 2020;Samiran Sadh..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;I am riding this bike for 2 months and the bike is just rocks. The bike is very powerful according to its segment, sometimes I feel that I am riding a 200cc bike or more. Some pros as per my views-1. Initial pickup is excellent.2. Midrange is mindblowing. Sometimes after midrange pull, you can feel, extra pickup..that might be because of VVA.3. At high-end it is smooth..Though I didn't test it bey ond 100kmph. But at the high end, you don't feel any vibration.4. Sporty design. Look and feel is class in its segment.5. Clutch is very light. As MT15 has an A&S clutch, no rear wheel locking at high gear & low-speed combination, and aggressive downshifting.6. Front braking is awesome, the rear one is ok ok.7. mileage is good.8. Side stand engine cut-off feature enabled.Some cons as per my views--1. Front mudguard should be a little extended. The current one causes problems during the rainy season.2. The pillion seat should have a properly designed grab handles(The current one looks good but is not too useful). Also, the seat could be a little extended(Though most of the time I ride this bike with a pillion and we don't face any such problem. For two healthy persons, the seat length is not suitable for long rides).3. Yamaha should use some kind of radiator guards like KTM Or Dominar.Overall MT15 BS6 is a perfect choice.
Yamaha;MT15;5 Oct 2020;Sasi Tharan;4.2; Daily Commute ;It has been always an headache in dealing with the mechanics and supervisor over there in the Yamaha authorised service center THE NELLIKUPPAM INDUSTRIES located in the sub urban VILLUPURAM district of tamil nadu the complaint will be tedious if i start to list out the things right from the day one so highlighting only the important things 1)in 2020 February approached the service center for heari ng a weird noise from the engine and the vva was activated in the 7000 rpm instead of 7500 rpm,the supervisor said it was okay but after another 2 weeks the sound became worse by March first week and again went to the service center and asked for the service engineer availability and they said he will arrive only once a month ,and left the bike over there but the service engineer did not arrive at all ,so i asked the mechanics to look over the problem and it took almost three weeks to solve the problem.regarding this i have already filed a complaint online but no proper response was found2)again a coin ringing noise was coming from the engine and went to the service center and again asusual they said it was normal but again after two weeks the engine fault sign in the diplay is blinking if they had recognize the issue and resolved earlier this would have not become this worse
Yamaha;MT15;3 May 2020;Rajib Bhatta..;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours ;Hi All, 27th Aug'2019 I purchased my Dark Machine MT15 B4, My Previous bike was Yamaha R15 V1, After sold my R15, I'm just really confused to buy which bike to solve my purpose - Daily Commute & I love Bike Touring for all-terrain once in a year. Then I found the one Yamaha MT15, Last year I ride from Kolkata to Arunachal -Tawan on my machine, I really love to share about this machine - Good 3 dig it respectable speed up to 135Km/Hr, One of the most that I love it's fuel economy approx my bike average meter reading shown 2.0/100Km which comes to 50Km/Lt milage. Good Suspension & it's riding position for long travel. It's very easy to handle on any bumpy road, off-road & good road too due to its weight. Slipper Clutch & VVA technology works awesome - you can feel the power output after 7K RPM. But like in every good quality there must some bad too. What I personally feel. 1. The fuel tank is not enough for any long travel - total capacity 10Lt - 8Lt main & 2Lt reserve and which need to be there for Fi Fuel Pump. Fuel Tank must be around 12Lt 2. The headlight is good enough for city ride but fades away on the highway you need more extra lights for the highway on this bike. Those 2 drawbacks which I found on my recent trips approx 3600Km done. KOL - ARUNACHAL -KOL.
Yamaha;MT15;31 Jul 2020;Sketch Carnival;3.8; Daily Commute;Let me be frank on this topic . Have been watching lot's of videos and researching on MT15 in india . The price is a bit high compared to the R15 because of the lack Cast Aluminium Swing Arm , all LED lights , USD fork and dual disk brakes . MT is cheaper by only few thousand rupees but i would love that to be almost around 15000 compared to the R15 .. But the best part is the engine . Let it be o n low rpm or high the engine out performs all the 150cc - 160cc bikes in india , it also gives a strong compitition to few 200cc bikes too . Secondly the mileage 40-45 plus mileage is promised with no drop in performance and i don't believe there is any other bike in the market which can out run the MT 15 in terms of performance with mileage . MT has a weight of 138kgs which is very light which helps the rider to do easy flicks in the cities and High rpm performance ensures high speed in highways .. 10 ltr fuel tank is a bit on the less side compared to other bikes in the market but the mileage of 45+ ensures a long distance travel with a full tank .. Take a test drive and if your heart tells you this is the one for you go for it . Money is nothing but figures of zeros and ones .. bike is a feeling and an emotion thats personal..
Yamaha;MT15;1 Oct 2020;Akash Surve;4.6; Daily Commute ;Review after first Service 1000km in 20 days After sales service is OkaySeat Comfort: It is Good for City ride , needs extra seat cushion for long ride (Because it's street fighter/ city commuter sports bike)Suspensions: soft in slower speed, stiffer in high speed because of linked mono suspensionPerformance: pickup is so good (after all Master of Torque). you won't regret at any time in city mild traffic and highway.Build Quality: Premium\Average build quality, Mud guards are not useful at all. Needs extension for front mud guardLittle Vibrations feel after 65kmph.. mirrors are also vibrating above 70kmph... I don't know why!? I didn't hear this in YouTube review.Big Instrumental console, DRL, Head light, Ice flip vermilion colour are eye catcher.Instrumental console's features are very useful (live kmpl, avg kmpl, avg kmp/100L , trip1 trip2 tripF(auto Reserved mode), Time)Also we can hang/lock Double D ring helmet directly using under seat Helmet Holder.Wrost thing is no space for any other than documents under the seat.Milage: I am receiving 45kmpl in heavy traffic of Mumbai, 56kmpl in city and 67kmpl on highway with speed/extra premium fuel on MT 15 bs6 in Mumbai.. that's really amazing ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è
Yamaha;MT15;29 Oct 2020;Aditya Vyas;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Performance is good, The bike riding posture is straight and it will not harm your shoulders & back after long rides. The power of the bike is quite realistic and immeasurable, Mt gives an immense amount of power to be needed for daily use for city rides as well as on highways. The average is quite good, After your 3rd servicing, It will give an average of about 35 km/h. And, Lastly about it's loo ks- I had purchased mt15 ice fluo vermillion, I.E orange alloys with a white finish on the tank and trust me that look just awesome and this color variant of mt15 is eye-catching & once you take this on-road, Many people will stare your bike more than you. The headlamps are good, But when you will be riding this bike at night on highways, you will definitely feel the light's are not worth it. Anyway, Here's my small review about my mt15 ice fluo vermillion bs6 single-channel abs and one more thing, Mt seat is too small to fit for 3 riders, So tripling can be dangerous although, Rider and pillion seat is quite comfortable to thank you Yamaha for making us feel proud a proud mt owner.

Yamaha;MT15;7 Aug 2020;Pranoy Sharma;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Everything Is Good In Terms Of Performance, Riding Dynamics,Features N Mileage. 1st Negative Point Yamaha Should Offer Dual Channel ABS because The Range Of This Motorcycle Is 1.40 Lakhs N Secondly The Most Important Feedback Is The Length Of Pillion Seat‚àö With Grab Rails N To Be Honest It's Really Pathetic. If This Issue Is Not Fixed Yamaha Will Definitely Disappoint All The MT15 Lovers N Will Regret It With The Company Sales For Sure.
Yamaha;MT15;4 Nov 2020;Sri Goutham;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;For just 150 cc its lit.Its more power for a150cc bike with a more than enough mileage of 47 to 50 km per liter.Perfect street bike and an average tourer.Low maintenance lol that all we want, But for a 150 cc its a bit pricey and misses dual channel abs, Upside down forks, Different swingarm, Alloys which are present in international variant although its a good bike for beginners.Overall a good pr actical bike.

Yamaha;FZ25;21 Apr 2020;Sourav Maity;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;This bike is a value for money. I have completed 3 trips with my fz25 (Spiti, Bhutan , Sikim Gurdongmar lake) also use it for daily commute (approx 80 km a day) abd I had never faced any problem with my bike. Handling is excellent, mileage is superb (42kmpl) low on maintenance. On the lower side headlights dull in pitch dark. Headlamp should be more powerful,
Yamaha;FZ25;5 Jan 2020;Rongon Phukan;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;A good practical bike for the city and Highways too. At the end of the day most people like to cruise at speeds of 110-115 and this bike is just phenomenal at those speeds. Anyone who thinks of touring at speeds in excess of 130-140 needs to look elsewhere. A very underrated bike and with the addition of ABS its just a superb proposition.
Yamaha;FZ25;29 Oct 2020;Sayantan Bhadra;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;The bikes performance is really good.The 250cc engine is really powerful and the bike doesn't vibrate at high speeds.I have clocked 130-135 kmph with ease.Mileage depends on the person who rides it.I have kept it well maintained and i get a mileage of about 33-35 kmpl.The braking is also really good.Overall it is a very good machine.

Yamaha;FZ25;4 Apr 2019;Pradeep Savaji;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;I completed 25000km till now, i have very good feeling with the bike, gets ample mileage of 44 km/ltr (depends on ridind style), Performance of the bike is awesome, its not for the top end speeds, is best suited for power rides for your daily commutes/Tours.The cons i noticed are: Maintenance is not cheap, Styling is a level below awesome, Digital console isnt really satifying one(But it justifies with the price point),Headlamps illumination is pathetic."Overall its best entry level performance bike, Suggests to go for it"
Yamaha;FZ25;12 Oct 2019;Nungshi Mangang;3.0; Daily Commute ;It is a good bike but I have some complaint. There is a noise which comes out from backside and it is disturbing me a lot while riding this motorcycle and also the dual accelerator cable locker jumps the accelerator throttle. These 2 problems are facing after 1 year of purchased.
Yamaha;FZ25;17 Oct 2020;Bruce Wayne;4.6; Daily Commute ;I loved it, its big muscular chisel tank. FZ25 looks and designs are very aggressive on the street fighter. Milage is great as a 250cc bike. It is lightweight only 149 kgs with low seat height, Suitable for most average height and tall riders.
Yamaha;FZ25;8 Jan 2020;Ithyavendhan K;4.6; Daily Commute ;Daily commute was good.... mileage was excellent... get around 40kmph in Town.. 32 in highways when you ride n triple digits...

Yamaha;FZ25;16 Jul 2020;Mithinga Nar..;3.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Occasional Commute ;The Mirror should be upgraded so that it looks more attractive like Dominor 400 and the LED headlight should be more powerful so that during the night ride the power of the LED should be Sharp and Bright and also it should provide LED indicator for more attractive.

Yamaha;FZ25;31 Aug 2019;Dineshkumar ..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Has a very good torque. In city it's very nimble and for weekend getaways it is good as well. To use in ghat sections its very involving to ride. Softer front suspension and brakes could have been little better. But in the latest ABS version brakes are better.
Yamaha;FZ25;15 Nov 2019;Bharat Krshna;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;This is one piece of amazing machinery!

Yamaha;FZ25;22 Mar 2020;Vivan Surange;3.8; Daily Commute | Tours ;Very good acceleration but lesser top speed cuz only 5 gears are there. So expressway driving could be time consuming but it'll comfortably cruise at 110kph higher than that kinda upsets the calm of the engine.
Yamaha;FZ25;11 Nov 2020;AARISH SONI;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Awesome performance in hilly and plain areas and very comfortable all over.Its a very good bike for maximum two riders only and the pickup and power of this machine is great.I love these type of bikes so much.

Yamaha;Fazer153;30 Apr 2020;Sridhar C;4.2; Daily Commute ;üëâDo's-1. Satisfactory mileage2. Good road stability and road grip,3. Good lighting & flashlights,4. Good rear suspension,5. Seating Comfort,6. Satisfied City mileage of 40 kpl, & 45 kpl on highways.7. Satisfied Riding Speeds at different road's & road grips.üëâDon't -1. Front suspension is not satisfactory & I asked the company to introduce inverted fork, but they failed since 2009 until now.2 . Braking speed is lacking & I asked them to introduce Rear Disc Brake soon during 2009 but they didn't do so until hopefully 2018 in next to next version of it. This means that the company's survey to meet up to the requirements of the rider's is lacking. But I find that Honda Motor's having launched their competitive sport bikes from CBR 150 c.c, CBR 250 c.c that made well than this Fazer 153 c.c bike as for it's lightness and handling, mileage, speed, looks and more better instrument panel feature's & vehicle speed & braking efficiency. I HOPE THAT YAMAHA SHOULD MAKE OUT THEIR TIMELY CORRECTIONS NOW AND THEN TO MEET IN COMPETITION WITH THE SIMILAR OTHER SPORT BIKES.(Even until now Yamaha has not launched it's YZF R6 Racing bike since 2 decades,& this is disgusting as the Honda has done with its Honda cbr 650 made for touring purpose & might be even 650R might roll out as sooner as possible to compete with the other 600+ c.c sport bike's available in Indian market now by different brand's.SO, MY ABOVE VIEW IS BEYOND MY FAZER 153 C.C BIKE , AS FOR MY DESIRE FOR THAT R6 bike also.

Looks are subjective; I love the plain and simple design of the bike with no fancy plastics. Front disc brake assembly from Gladiator, wider tyres and Gas rear shocks make it a modern and a fully capable road King. Spares availability is a big pain with poor support from Yamaha.

Yamaha;RX100;18 Jan 2019;Hormazd Irani;3.0; Occasional Commute ;I am the 5th owner of this bike. When I bought it, it was in poor overall shape. However by sheer dedicated effort, I contacted an expert in RX matters and slowly but surely managed to revive my bike to the original standards of performance. Then I met a mechanic who took on the job of painting my bike and then it was almost looking like a new bike. I would get frequent enquiries from many youngst ers, asking if I was willing to sell my bike to them. Little did they know the blood, sweat and tears which had gone into restoring this bike. Now I hear that the central government wants to do away with all two stroke vehicles, no matter what their lineage. This is an injustice to the future generation, who will otherwise only see them in photos.

Firstly I drive my Bike & i can realize the difference between my previous Motorcycle.When i reached my home i feel much better to ride this bike. It has so speed though i can‚Äôt take the top speed. I am worried about it‚Äôs mileage because only 20 kmpl mileage of it‚Äôs. It is not unusal also cz it has 321 cc very powerfull engine.As a describer on my bike. It‚Äôs so nice, big & styling. Braking system is just owsome. Relax seat system i very enjoy to seat here & ride experience. When i bought this bike it gives me 25 kmpl mileage now after 4,000 km it gives me 20 kmpl mileage. I am sure about that it gives me this mileage a long time because i concern about this mileage with a specialist. This mileage is not a matter for me. I make a long tour about 600 km per one day when I & my friend make a journey by Motorcycle. I notice one think that i have not suffer from my neck pain for riding a long drive. It‚Äôs 2 chanel Abs system is so working i just trial about this Abs syestem with my safety dress. But good news it‚Äôs work just super for the result I observe my experience without any injury .For the long time with this bike i want to tell all of bike rider that it is really a nice bike. I don‚Äôt tell to claim it mine as a rider i enjoy it & it gives me speedy ,comfort , abs safety & most of popular ause it gives me Styling bike riding Experience. My son also enjoy this bike to seat behind me .The young man tell me pappa more speed, more speed. But all time i ride my bike with a fresh sence & secure. I change gear oil regularly & service for a month regular. I have no more big cost in behind this bike . It is so free for me now at all. At the last I tell one think I really enjoy this bike & I also love my this Yamaha YZF-R3 Bike.
Yamaha;YZFR3;7 Feb 2020;Jewel James;5.0; Leisure Rides | Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Got this as my first bike and put 11,000 miles on it in 6 months. City miles. Got it with 0 miles and it is now just under 30,000. I had some recall work done pertaining to oil pan or something? I‚Äôve laid it down twice and I‚Äôve dropped it 3 or 4 times. Only maintenance cost was a new battery after around 4.5yrs, brake pads, and a new chain. AND a new low beam headlight kit from my accident at 50mph (internal structure, not outside), new shift lever which could have probably been bent back with heat if needed)and then changing my oil a little too often.She‚Äôs been good to me and when I started driving semi‚Äôs, she was ready to ride after sitting for weeks at a time without a battery tender. Flaws: if I let off electric start too soon on a bad startup it occasionally putters a little trying attempt 2(perhaps mild flooding?) This only happens if I turn off very briefly after a rigorous ride where she‚Äôs pretty hot still. This has been an issue that I noticed before probably 3-5,000 miles. When I was around 150lbs I let off of it at 125mph, yet google states top speed is 118... People think it‚Äôs a 600 and I think it‚Äôs a 150 üòÖ but it was just what I was looking for and more! Great buy!
Yamaha;YZFR3;16 Sep 2019;Kamal Singh;5.0; Occasional Commute ;Absolutely perfect & One of the least offensive stock exhaust which has a deep throaty roar as revs climbs. Power delivery is very smooth & linear, so no sudden burst of power at lower rpm, however past 7000rpm punch increases all the up to red line. Though on a bit expensive side still best bang for your buck. Though brakes could have been better, front brakes feel bit spongy but a steel braided brake line should take care of it.
Yamaha;YZFR3;21 Dec 2018;Karthik Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute ;Yzf r3 is the besk bike but it is kinda problem also.1) Starting issue always even after showing it to the yamaha service center 3 times.2)Recalling of the bikes after paying a rich amount of money on this bike.3)No option for old bikes to go for abs while ktm 390 has the same.

Average was initially 55-60 but as of now it's 65+. It improved after 3rd service. No vibration at 65kmph speed. Comfort to drive with medium speed. Easy to handle. Only problem is gears shifting is hard. Specially first and second. Hope the mileage will stay as it is for l ong time :). Best of luck..
Yamaha;Saluto;18 Nov 2018;RAJKUMAR A;4.6; Daily Commute ;Been driving for 4 months. I get a mileage of 62kmpl (if driven at 40-50 km speed) in typical high traffic metro. The only disadvantage I felt is the extremely low weight. When driving in highway, if we are to face high wind speeds, I felt like being moved along the wind. Losing the stability while facing higher wind speeds. No other Negatives for this bike. Eagerly looking for a long travel.

Yamaha;SZRR;9 Sep 2020;AMIT KUMAR;3.4; Daily Commute ;Good for daily commute. Like the rising position and the shifting is smooth. But the After sales service of Yamaha is pathetic. After 2days of purchasing, my bike had started to give problem. It stops automatically after riding 100 - 200 meter. Did not receive any help from the service centres for 2 days. The problem was fixed but they didn't reveal to me what was the actual matter. After 1sy serv icing I had noticed that a little amount of engine oil was deposited above the engine but when I visited the service center they told me that there was no leakage but unable to tell me where the engine oil came from. And I wasted my 2nd free servicing voucher there. In 3rd servicing , I again complained about it as engine oil started to pour on the ground beneath the engine when I parked my vehicle. This time they changed my tappet cover but the problem was not solved. The service adviser as well as the mechanic were not in the mood of listening to me. Then I shifted to local garage where the mechanic changed an oil seal and solved the problem. Till then, I have visited service centre various times whenever I need any parts but never got it in one visit, even the rear view mirrors too. Today I visited again for the handle grip as they were worn out but even those are not available there. I understand that it is not possible to make available every part but the behaviour of every personnel is very poor . They are stubborn guys. No matter whatever problem the customer is facing but they will only do whatever they want too. Simply pathetic again.
Yamaha;SZRR;18 Jul 2020;Review Vlogger;3.0; Daily Commute ;Looks not good..seating design could have been way better, though quite comfortable..side design on petrol tank with dual tone looks awkward and ungainly..coming to the headlight, its the worst, horns work good, needs choke often during start, braking in adequate, with good grip, front tyres are very very thin, not expected in a 150cc bike..body paint quality is cheap..no storage spaces..seats are not fixed properly, moves slightly, gears are not sleek, gives a thud, engine starts crying after 70kmph though it can go upto 100+ kmph..handling is good..silensor sounds little cheap..
Yamaha;SZRR;13 Aug 2020;Anupran Kumar;1.8; Occasional Commute;This bike headlight is really bad if you r driving in night in busy road and the tyre they provide is really bad as it does not have proper grip or contact with the road. secondly the service center whenever you take they will everytime ask you replace as thy don't want to repair or clean any thing they just wanna to make money and do the service as fast as you can. I m not sure that whether they are changing engine oil or not just because whenever I took they will ask me to change and they will do but don't know whether they actually do or not.
Yamaha;SZRR;10 Sep 2019;Kameshwar4u;4.6; Daily Commute ;Very light good ground clearance, good for daily commute, maintenance is less on this bike. I did 38000 km with small trips(300-400 km up and down). Changed both tyres to Michelin, ByBRE brakes, Battery once post 30km...Mileage all depends on how you ride at time for me it was low around 28-32 after recent servicing at Yamaha showroom. It gradually increased and now it's giving 40-42.
Yamaha;SZRR;19 Nov 2019;Silambarasan B;1.4; Daily Commute;I bought this in 2017 and mileage is not crossed 40, Too much maintenance cost ad product quality is too low. Because clutch cable, speedometer cable is not working after 6 months. Too many small accessories I've changed after 1 year. Before that I've passion plus with more than 7 years.it gives me 70 mileage and not changed any core accessories like this bike(clutch,speedometer).

Yamaha;RayZ;3 Aug 2020;Arshan Ahmed;4.2; Daily Commute ;Performance is the best in class. The engine delivers excellent and optimum performance. Overtaking or sharp bends and cuts are quite comfortable. Brakes are average and tyre has pretty good grip. Mileage is the issue but it can be improved with regular service. Driving comfort is pretty nice with neat to smooth handling. Vibrations are above the speed of 70 and the shock absorber is decent for th e price.overall nice sporty bike for casual use.

Bajaj;Pulsar150;15 Jun 2020;Himanshu Kit..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;When it comes to the best 150cc bike or for daily use just close your eyes and opt for **P****ulsar 150**. I am having the same and some of its special qualities felt by me are:- 1. It **looks so lovely when dim light glows in the handle** and at the **front side during sunset time**.2. Mixture of **simplicity and stylish feature**.Enclosure:- latest pic of my bike with me which is looking like a **newly bought one:-**3. **Awesome sound** when the accelerator is taken.4. Reaches to a **high speed in a couple of second**.5. Good **mileage of approx 45** and best for daily use.6. The best part is **digital meter with green light**.7. **Long life** and most running evergreen bike.8. The most important is it looks like a new one after years also.Take my example I bought it more than 3 years ago but when I clean it lil bit, it seems that I bought it just now and mostly people ask me whether I have bought another new one or what.So my suggestion is** just to grab it **and I love it and you must have heard **'life ki pehli bike kaafi special hoti‚Äù**.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;17 Oct 2020;Abhi Bus;3.4; Daily Commute ;it has been 2 months and i almost ride 50km a day and the style and riding angle is very good and breaking too is fine ofcourse its a new one everything will be fine for couple of years.coming to performance okay pickup and it wont go any further than 110kmph recently i traveled 610km 305 way up and 305 return where i didnt stop for a single instace which it took 3hrs and 24mins one side early mor ning at 109kmph as the bike automaticallytries to stop once it crosses 110on didgital meter it wont go any further than that although only 1st servicing is done.mileage at 109kmph it gave 44 to 46 and at 70kmph without any hard breaking it gave 49 to 51.if you can sustain at 40kmpl then go for top speed 200cc bike like rtr2004v or ns200 rs200 or ktm200cc ofcourse r15 legend in 150cc segment.i need 50kmpl in city road with comfort seating and bulky look so i chose pulsar 150twin disc
Bajaj;Pulsar150;8 Oct 2020;Kaushik Pawar;2.6; Daily Commute ;Respected sir, I had purchased Bajaj Avenger cruise 220 bike from Gems automobile hadpsar branch Pune. It was was purchased on 02/02/2018.But within two years it's speedometer display stopped working. Now due to covid 19 lock down I couldn't go to showroom. But now since everything has started I visited showroom for defect to get cleared. But it was come to notice that part must be replaced, now i t's value is 3014 as per update received from showroom.My concern is how such low quality part was installed and if so do I must get it done in warrenty? If within two years any costly parts get's damaged it must be replaced in warrenty. My bike not ever had any accident nor any scratches.My humble request to look into the matter and communicate to concerns regarding same.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;8 Oct 2019;SacHiN M;4.6; Daily Commute;If we ask bajai customer care for a simple clarification, they would redirect us to showroom only. What is the use of this customer care ID. Useless. After getting to showroom, i came to know that Bajaj Neon is heavily priced. Not a budgeted vehicle. Cost is 25000 more than show room price (up to 15000 more is acceptable). They are misleading customers. Response for customer care email is also not clear. They wont give you details. They suggest you to go to showroom. But showroom will give you huge price for neon. Adding 6000 to that amount we could get a Apache rtr 4v abs single disc vehicle. Neon is old model with old spare parts. Their pricing is much high for a old stock vehicle parts.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;28 Oct 2020;Ganesh Adhith;5.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;Pulsar 150 is a fantastic machine which is pocket friendly with low maintenance cost and wide spare parts availability. It's still not outdated and one can see a lot of new pulsars on road even today. Its seat is really comfortable with not so upright and not so bent down riding position, It's somewhere in the middle & I just love it. I don't get tired that easily. Brakes are pretty decent but cou ld have been better, Although I own a standard variant. I guess the twin disc variant will be fine but the graphics and stickers are good on the standard variants. However, it depends on one's taste & preference. It's good for city commutes and occasional touring. It's one of a bike that gives reasonable mileage and power.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;9 Jan 2020;PRASAD JADHAV;1.8; Daily Commute;Before I purchase I sold my pulsar 180 ug4 Now I brought pulsar 150 ug5 duel disk,After one month issues come start , firs issue oil leakage,2nd issue alignment3rd issue performance, 4th & very iriteting issue is con set I change my con set 3rd time in 5 months , still issue is same, also change change sprocket too, now macanic said cluch plate issue .I am now done with this bike.... Really Bajaj wants to make some changes with it, 1st cc need to upgrade at least 160 or 170 cc, beacouse of body weight, 2nd parts availability, 3rd gear box with 6 gear. I brought bike from kanchan Bajaj ulhas nagar Mumbai.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;17 Sep 2020;Gouranga Ch;3.8; Daily Commute ;It's been a mixed experience for me. Once or twice it posed problems for me. One thing I would like to share my bitter experience about sipping water into the fuel tank. It was noticed that rain water gathering around the opening of the tank overflows into the tank and causes starting problems. The holes around the tank get choked after period of time. The Company should look into the matter. Anot her inconvenience I would like to mention that after washing the bike its key does not work properly. The problem can be sorted out by pouring engine oil into the key hole. Otherwise it works nicely.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;7 Dec 2019;Sandeep Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours;It has been a great and exciting experience with this bike. This is my third 150 cc plusar bike. I love this bike for its combination of power and mileage. I always had choice and freedom in other segments but i bought it for third time.I guess, My earlier bikes were bit smooth and powerful than the present one BSIV MODEL 2017. I had rode this bike in long distance touring of 360 KM in a single da y, believe me man it won't let you down. But, it gets choppy after 120 km ride on highway in one go. I am fond of this bike. Value for money but it should be maintained properly.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;10 Dec 2020;Harshavardha..;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have the 150 td bs4, Quite stylish top end model in pulsar 150.Performance is really good, Have no issue either in city or on highway.Just that sometimes i face cold start problem, That's common with most bikes.Drive in the 5th gear at 4000 rpm would be economical in case of my unit, Which is around 50kmph, With service done regularly, And your chain been cleaned and lubricated (since its open c hain) regularly, I am getting a mileage around 55 with ease.No issues till now expect cold start.With good maintenance you will end up having zero problems.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;14 Jan 2021;Faizal Syed;4.2; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Pros good styling on highways good.Sudden braking still controllable.It will not slide due to absrear wheel lift protection is great.Twice since i bought avoided two critical accidents consstock tyres not so good it can slide on sudden braking confidence is less at high speeds and at 7k km front tyre wear and tear more.May be because of abs brakes.Top speed only 107kmph??? engine will cut off beyo nd this speed difficult to turn in bumper to bumper traffic gear shift is very noisy and 5s some times gear will not shift down.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;31 Aug 2020;Joseph Rayapati;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Superb commuter bike.. check the engine oil in time and take tyre pressure without fail from time to time. If you are a person looking for a commuter bike with a bit of action then go for it.The backlogs are the seating it's good for speed trips like 10 to 30 k.m depends upon the speed that you travel ,but on a long journey a little bit of back pain is likely to take place and the resale value is also not that good..

Bajaj;Pulsar150;12 Jul 2020;Rohit Deo;3.0; Daily Commute;I own pulsar 150 twin disc bs6 from last 4 months. My daily riding is about 70 km. It's overall performance is ok. its mileage is about 53 kmpl. But when speed is increased above 60 ,feels lots of vibrations & pick up is also not quick & also suffering from chain sound problem. Also its shock absorbers are not smooth. I would recommend to clean & l**e its chain once in a week to avoid it's chain s ound problem. Built quality is awesome.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;7 Oct 2020;BONAFIDE 1;3.8; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;As of 150 cc it should at least produce 16bhp or 15nm torque . Maintenance is less compaires to other's in same cc segment. Weight is more compare to power. Top speed is locked at 110 kmph. O to 80 is good but 100 is not. also getting an average of 30 to 35 kmpl. Which should be more at least 40 to 45. Don't buy this 150cc . Buy at least 200cc bike or stay at 100 to 125 cc. Else r15 is perfect.

Bajaj;Pulsar150;10 Sep 2020;Saurabh Singh;4.2; Daily Commute ;This is solid and heavier version , but now days it is only for styling. It was made for masculine look and performance with acceptable mileage. If I have used roughly many times, and repairing maintinance cost was too high. Over all after splender this was highest selling bike that time.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;25 Sep 2019;DEBASIS MISRA;4.2; Daily Commute ;It was nice cruising the city roads. The gear lever function was bit difficult, particularly to turn the gear in neutral mode. Rain water pours down the petrol lock inside the petrol tank. The focus of head lights needs to be modified. Moreover the pick up and engine quality are superb.

Bajaj;Pulsar150;26 Dec 2018;Abhishek Cha..;4.6; Daily Commute ;I have Bajaj Pulsar 150 and it is BS III model. Bought it around 2012. Clocked around 90,000 Kms and it still retains that power and mileage. I believe that this bike has potential to rule Indian roads for one more decade, reason behind this is the cost, mileage, ease of maintenance, easy availability of genuine spare parts and that also at affordable price, kudos to its engine refinement which is getting better and better with newer models. In future if I would go for another bike I would surely pick one from the pulsar lineup.
Bajaj;Pulsar150;10 Jan 2019;Rehman Khan;2.6; Daily Commute ;I am using Pulsar 150 for last 10 years. I don't find it worth purchasing. Its maintenance is highest among all bikes, it's parts are also costly. Mileage is not good maximum 30- 35KMPL only. Every two years it requires engine work which costs me around Rs. 15000. In 6 years time the amount you will spend on Pulsar you can Purchase a new bike on that amount. I have spent more than Rs. 60000 on Pul sar in 10 years time. I really regret why I purchased Pulsar. Only good thing about Pulsar is it look stylish & has good pick up.

Bajaj;PulsarRS200;10 Oct 2020;Nirosh Niro95;4.6; Occasional Commute | Tours;Its been 3 months owning this bike, and i have to admit that this bike is my love.pros:1.Riding posture2.Better throttle response3.Absolutely beginner friendly4.ABS brakes have a better impact5:Impressive mileage around 38 to 42 6:Exhaust note pure eargasm7:Better top end performance 8:Bs6 variant have very minimal vibrations compared to the latter 9:Suitable for long rides10:projector headlamps a re the best in its classCons:1.Tyres atleast they should have given a 130 section radial tyres at the back and 110 section at front.Tyres are the main disadvantage they have provided a 130 section MRF nylogrip which isnt a radial tyre it doesnt inspires confidence but it is ok though.Its better to opt for a 130 or 140 sec radial tyre at back and for front 110 radial.
Bajaj;PulsarRS200;10 Jan 2019;Jay Pillai;4.6; Daily Commute ;It is good for starters in the Indian roads although one must be careful and should've ridden a 150cc bike for a while. Switching from a scooter to RS200 isn't recommended. The looks are arguable only for some people as some find it overstyled. I personally think taking the black model tones downs the overstyling. The lights are real good. Comfort for long rides is just okayish. The power is real good it hauls ass like no other. The engine is happy to rev and doesn't take long to hit the red line at 11,500 rpm. I have the non ABS version although I recommend the abs version. I have also had a crash with the bike and I'm glad I chose Bajaj as the entire right side of my bike was damaged and it cost me around 12k for the replacement which is considerably cheap. The service network is also widespread and the service depends on the person you are dealing with and how you deal with them. Rear million seat is only realistically possible for short distances. Overall I would recommend this bike as a good all rounder.
Bajaj;PulsarRS200;9 Dec 2019;Anmol Sharma;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;this bike is an awesome choice.you get a lot of things that includes good power, suspension, braking and damn good looks.Earlier i thought that its service cost will be high but that is very reasonable.i am using my bike since 2 years and to now it has not got any issues with it.Everything about this bike seems so good.Perfect for the streets and comfortable on long rides.I would like to say one t hing at last.GIVE LOVE AND CARE TO THIS ENGINE AND IT WILL NEVER BETRAY YOU.

Bajaj;PulsarRS200;14 Jun 2019;Bittu Biswas;4.6; Leisure Rides ;I am a very proud owner of Pulsar RS 200. First of all I would like to say about the look of it. It is simply awesome. Lots of time I found people are looking at this unblinkingly while I passed through. The mileage is also fair enough. I am getting near about 40-44 kmpl. The transmission is very smooth. But this bike is not suitable for your family like your mother or wife, specially if they are wearing saree. Otherwise it is great choice.

The cluster meter misses the gear shift indicator. The vibratons is always there. The chain and the spocket can be improved. The seats can be made a bit softer specially for the pillion rider.

Bajaj;CT100;29 Aug 2019;Prabhushankar G;2.2; Daily Commute ;I think there is issue with the petrol knob since the day one. Some times the petrol reaches the bottom on the verge to be dry when the knob is in the main/on position. I also asked the service center to check, but they say that it's working fine. Maybe that's the reason I am unable to gauge the exact mileage. My Royal Enfield 350 standard, 2000 model gives me a 30KMPL decent ride.

Bajaj;CT100;9 Jun 2020;Sujoy Nag;4.6; Daily Commute;I rode ct-100(original round headlamp) 2.8 lac KM in its 16th year (regd. expired) and is running perfectly keeping in mind its age. I traveled 300-400 KM in a day several times with ease & comfort.It still gives an average of 65-70 KMPL in city riding (‚Çπ 1/-per KM). 75 KMPL in highways at average speed of 60 KMPH. I maintain the bike myself.

Bajaj;CT100;15 Apr 2020;Mrutyunjayar..;4.6; Daily Commute;My bike is an excellent one. Used continuously for 16 years. Still its engine is in good condition.with excellent mileage. Regular minimum maintenance is sufficient. It is itself a giant. No extra care is taken during its tenure. Non availability of spare parts from the company is the main disadvantage.
Bajaj;CT100;7 Dec 2019;Mangesh Kapre;4.6; Daily Commute;I have CT100B. It is best. Low weight so good for persons above 50. Low maintenance needed.

Feel satisfied.

Head light focus is nice n clear. Some negatives, lacks comfort, the centre of gravity is not in place, so some issues while driving pillion.
Bajaj;CT100;5 Feb 2019;Susmit Sarkar;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours ;This is my second bike after Hero Puch, and it has been amazing. I do maintain it but one thing is sure... this is a workhorse. The 100cc engine is a gem and in city it used to give 80+ kmpl everytime.Since past few years I"m not using it, still it will get started in one kick. It may not have styling and features but what it lacks it makes it by its performance. It can go all day at 60-70 kmph an d won"t compliant.I still have it and would keep it with me for years to comes.

Bajaj;CT100;15 Jun 2019;Manohar Vasi..;3.4; Daily Commute ;CT 100 is reliable for mileage and from initial pickup to performance is same as Splendour or HF deluxe.No CG balance and road grip due to small wheel size, breaking and ride controlling is major issue in this bike.Good for max 60km speed on highway with less breaking.When it comes to quality you get for what you paid.

Bajaj;Dominar400;9 Sep 2019;Varun Panwar;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;my hunt for a new bike started two weeks ago. i wanted a bike that was reasonably priced and fun to ride , mileage was not an issue for me as I am not a daily commuter(this is what i thought initially but now i cant resist it taking daily to office)test rides taken before buying dominar 20191. apache rtr 200 4v smooth engine, no vibrations, right balance of performance and comfort2 honda cbr250- l acked modern features, a little pricey3. RE classic 350- showroom experience was best among all the bike brands in India, thumping engine/exhaust , great bike but i was hungry for more power4. yamaha FZ25 - decent bike, smooth engine,nothing to complaint about as such5. wanted to test ride gixxer 250 but was not available at the nearest showroom.6. i ruled out duke 390 as iam not a pro rider and i would have not done justice considering the potential of the bike(but my next bike would definitely be a KTM )6. finally went to bajaj dealership the moment i started the dominar ignition i felt that i have woken up a beast the exhaust note was so good to ears at that very moment my hunt ended and i bought the bike2week/300km review.-i kept the bike under 2.5k-3k rpm and i got 35 kmpl( no heavy traffic during my office commute)- power delivery is linear - bassy exhaust note- bearable vibrations in handle bar,tank and foot pegs- headlamps are the best- secondary display is useless( though bajaj has rolled out ECU update to position gear indicator on primary console.)will update review after 1st serviceupdate: after first service bike feels a bit smoother than before. mileage 25- 32kmpl
Bajaj;Dominar400;16 Dec 2020;Bharanidaran..;4.6; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;Every bike is good, however it is just a match of your requirements against the machine. so my requirements were1. Powerful engine: at 40ps power revving to 8,500 rpm, you will never feel the power is less2. Comfortable riding position: I had plan to use bike for long drives and occasional commute and for this purpose I would surely need a good riding position. Am 6 feet tall and this bike surely is very comfortable and you sit fairly upright with a good riding posture3. Safety and comfort: Dual channel ABS, biggest disc pads in segment, Slipper clutch, USD, Monoshocks, Refined BS6 engine you will feel you are driving a very safe and well planted bike, it did not seem to swerve or you will never hesitate to rev it higher and brake instantly. the bike will just be so composed to bring you to a standstill with no effort at all.4. Latest tech: although the speedo is not comprehensive as KTM. it certainly is not vintage which brings smile to my face. Also the all LED headlamps are a beast, it illuminates even a vanta black road to daylight.5. Service cost: Owned a pulsar all my life.am aware Bajaj costs will be considerably less or moderate when compared to other manufacturers. Also the service interval being 5k Kms, Dominor does deliver for long haul and with few lesser worriesSo if your checklist of bike purchase matches mine do not hesitate to buy this Phenomenally well-made sport tourer by Bajaj!!
Bajaj;Dominar400;29 Oct 2020;Ritwik Mukhe..;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;The brakes of the dominar 400 ug can get better by just few changes master cylynder update sinterd brakes pads these are only applied for front brakes the rear brake is too sensitive when i press the brake in my d400 ug it hits back due to the abs kicks in because its too sensitive i would recomand to bajaj to upgrade to 9m bosch abs program to solve this problem which is used in ktm machine and i would suggest bajaj that not to go with mrf revz c1 rather to go with applo h1 alpha because its made up of better tyre compund and it is made up of two comound hard in the middle with made up of hard rubber wich give more mileage and less wear and tear and in the sides they have used soft compound which more cofidence and in the corrners andits handles the bike better and it is made in india bajaj shoud go i theeth in the back which wii give it final drive of 15/44 ans i dominar shoud lose some kgs in the dry weight because the its power to weight ratio wil increase and espicaly silencer shoud lose few kgs because of that bike could not balance properly and it always tend to go ti the right side and beacuse of that i hand is always carring more weight and preassure to balance the bike and its a tyring thingthing in long rides and except this bike is best in class bajaj has done a great job rhats why its called the the most loved indian
Bajaj;Dominar400;31 Mar 2020;Siddhartha M..;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;üíö it is... but coming with many problems within 6 months... thats most disappointing.... Pillion seat is not comfortable atall for Long Rides.... Mileage is not that great what I really expected... but riding this bike is really fun.... it's flawless upto 154KMPH... soo smooth.... after that it lags....styling is great n I am in Love with the GREEN üíö colour....maintainence cost is very low.. . I just loved that thing... but the Front Visor could have been a bit longer to stop the massive wind blast.... but the bike is very powerful... but there are plenty of issue in it.. just name it n problem starts... one of major issue in problem shifting grears up n down smoothly for the typical bajaj bikes gear problem which jumps 2nd to Neutral dirrectly... throttle response is Fine though.... Exhaust note was great in the beginning but day by day it fades.. Great bike for Touring... not that great for daily commute... Bajaj should hire more intelligent n Efficient Tech who can service this bike soo well.... this is a huge issue after buying service... horrible service.. need to be improved... else everything is great... b
Bajaj;Dominar400;4 May 2020;ArjithUnnikr..;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;I had Many Choices But I Chose Dominar 400 Only Because of its Linear Power and To Use it as A Multi Purpose Vehicle! I usually Gets a Mileage of 24 to 28 in City and 32+ on Highways! The Maintenance Cost is Much Less as Compared and Also, its a Value for Money Stuff! But Yeah! As the Price decreases, the quality also decreases... So don‚Äôt keep that much expectations on this bike! Engine is not That Reliable! But overall! The Built Quality is Quite Fascinating! If you respect the bike, it will Respect you ;). The riding Posture is Not Fully Upright! A slight bent is there while you sit on it. As the bike is little heavy from front, it might give you a wrist pain but yeah, you will be use to it soon! Its good for Cities and A Beast on Highways with such Good Stability! You can also do a little offroads! In Short, Dominar 400 is like a Pocket Rocket‚ù§Ô∏è
Bajaj;Dominar400;10 Jun 2019;Abhilash Manari;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;First thing first: "The best value for money bike in this segment"Pros: - Good mid and top end power- Good seating position- Fare milage for a 373 cc bike- Awesome light throw by the headlights- Gives confidence while overtaking- The sound of the engine is Damm sweet, just love that bassy roar when I twist the throttle- One great feature that I saw in this bike is that, u can"t start the ride with out disengaging the side stand, bike engine will go off if the side stand is engaged. So the accidents that could happen because of the negligent engagement of side stand is nullified here.- Breaking is Damm great, thanks to the dual channel absCons:- Weight: Bike is quite heavy, you won"t feel it once u picks up speed, it feels mostly when u try to pull the bike backwards or while parking.- Cornering: The bike has below average cornering capacity, again weight could have been a factor here.- Handle turn extend: The turning radius of the bike is quiet high, so it"s often difficult to turn the bike in a narrow street, and the weight of the bike makes it even more difficult.- Vibration: Even though the vibrations have said to be reduced compared to the previous model, still I can feel the vibrations on the handleOn an over all aspect, If u are looking for a bike which can do city commutes and highway cruising, and cruise at tripple digit speeds, go for it,Dominar is a beast
Bajaj;Dominar400;16 Aug 2020;C;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;It is my first motorcycle, I have not ridden a motorcycle before in my life, my previous experience is with a small car and a mountain bike. I started three months ago, now I do routes of 40 minutes to an hour, in the city and on the highway, my maximum speed based on my little experience has been 150 km / h maximum, both during the day, night or light rains and storms, at the moment very noble ve ry docile when you control your clutch and throttle well. In short, YES IT IS A GOOD MOTORCYCLE FOR BEGINNERS, it depends on your motivation to develop your skills and ride, in my case I can tell you that the best thing is to hit the road.
Bajaj;Dominar400;4 Feb 2020;PRATAPCHANDRA;4.2; Daily Commute ;1) Engine refinement should be more better.2) fuel tank must be atleast 20 liters.3)some service centers in lucknow do not know about ecu update of this bike and they always ignore this.4) The bike's alignment goes right side on the road5) Bluetooth connectivity must install in this premium bike6) Not a major issue but its my personal issue that the bike should has center stand or provide by the s ervice centers7) I hope bajaj will provide color instrumental console in future8) Hazard light button missing in this power cruiser.9) Twin cylinder can be more fun in this bike10) Switchable ABS and riding modes are missing.11) Bajaj should work on vibrations
Bajaj;Dominar400;15 Aug 2020;Satish Khorj..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Dominar 400 ug is great bike from bajaj i use this bike on daily basis as well as on long jurney/ tour.. i love the performance n handling of this bike especially the high speed stability of this bike the crusing speed of this bike around 90 ti 130km. Talkin about mileage i get around 26 to 28 in city & 38 to 42 on highway or long tour..The only thing i dislike of this is center/ main stand since its a sports tourer it must have one... the USD front fork n soft rear suspension offer great comfort n ride quality üëå the up right sitting position of this bike is great for daily usge as well fr weekends or long rides...
Bajaj;Dominar400;11 Sep 2019;Chhanhima Ch..;4.2; Daily Commute ;Have owned the first generation ABS model. The built quality is good, ride quality is good and is rich in features. Mileage is good enough for a 400cc motorcycle. However problems keep creeping in quite early. The steering is hard to control and find that the bearings got crushed, ABS suffers faulty sensor, engine ideally stays at more then 3000rpm even in neutral while on the move and drops to no rmal only at standstill. Apart from this its a good motorcycle whatsoever.
Bajaj;Dominar400;22 Jul 2020;Hanok Deleep;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;I rate my bike because I am in love with it..even though it weighs 182 kg it handles the twisties sort of nicely..the ride comfort is awesome,the 10led headlight offers best in class illumination..let me tell you one thing,if you want a bike between the high on track duke 390 and the simple bullet 500 the best choice is the dominar.but there are things which are lacking like the gear indicator and stuff.p.s:my bike is bs4 and it's in canyon red
Bajaj;Dominar400;25 May 2020;Satish;3.0; Daily Commute ;Awesome bike. ..... smooth af ..... I'm getting mileage of 26 km pl to 27 km pl in city ....and on highways I'm getting 30-31 km pl which is best for 400 cc bike .......best buy n value for money .. excellent bike ..... Services centers of bajaj is very bad ...they don't know about bikes only cons is. services of bajaj otherwise it's super sexy bike.
Bajaj;Dominar400;2 May 2020;Ghan Adhikary;4.6; Tours ;The comfort is great ... Power delivery is too good with an ample amount of torque which also helps in highway overtakes..... There is this sudden urge of power that instills confidence in the rider ..... Also the brakes are moderate with a good quality ABS system... The headlamps are too good and provide articulated vision under all conditions....
Bajaj;Dominar400;17 Jan 2021;Manajit Singh;3.8; Tours;well I was tricked by the Bajaj showroom I wanted to buy the Dominar UG and in a hurry there was the old Dominar edition and I asked them when it will arrive they said it will take 2,3 months. anyway I bought it is my fault I regret sometimes for not having patience. still I enjoy Dominar and it's a decent bike
Bajaj;Dominar400;9 Jan 2021;Deepak Savre;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;It's pick up and comfort is superb in touring it's very good for handling and the weight of the bike is suitable for highway riding and the performance of the bike is also good in highways i really enjoy the riding in my dominar i travelled twice to my native place kolhapur from chennai
Bajaj;Dominar400;5 Aug 2020;Surya N;5.0; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;That's the overall package that payback worthly for your üí∞ money! completely satisfied with the bike! i just loved it, not that am saying because i own it ,all because i bought that VFM bike which satisfies all my needs! I'm sure you can get it without any doubt and hesitation!
Bajaj;Dominar400;10 May 2019;Krish Vayaz;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;It's the best VFM bike available in India at the moment! I was considering Interceptor 650, but test drove this and zeroed on this. This is a wonderful machine. It loves to corner and zoom through the streets with ease. Take it on the open highway, you can cruise comfortably at 120kmph. It does everything a bigger bike can do at a very reasonable price. Build quality is very good as well. Overall I would say, grab one before Bajaj rises the pricing of this motorcycle. Its a steal at this price!. Well done, Bajaj
Bajaj;Dominar400;5 Mar 2020;AKC Life;3.8; Occasional Commute | Tours ;there are some fit and finish problems which I'm facing from the very first day and some engine related problems are there too. but other than that it is great machine. sounds really good according to a single cylinder engine. it is a fun bike for highway.
Bajaj;Dominar400;1 Jan 2021;JH07 Harsh;4.6; Daily Commute ;Amazing bike as per its price range 1.Best bike in its price range.2.Good handling.3.Mileage is good for a 400cc bike(28-32 depends riding style).4.Best for long rides.5.Abs works well.6.Perfect bike for people who are above 5.4 feet tall.
Bajaj;Dominar400;28 Mar 2020;Manu B;2.6; Daily Commute ;This bike is good as it is designed to be. There are some engineering faults but they are not a big deal. One of the major problem was the LH side pulling above 70kmph , took some time to resolve it.It would be a great value for money
Bajaj;Dominar400;2 Nov 2020;Achuth Lekshman;4.6; Tours ;For the price tag it's a great value for money and in terms of performance i really love my d400.The engine performance is great the only drawback i got is the bikes a little too heavy and also the vibrations and buzz over the tank.

Bajaj;Dominar400;22 Sep 2019;Mohan Pkfoun..;2.6; Tours ;After 2 and half years and 33 K KM riding, I can say that it's a third class bike. Cheap parts, broke frequently and you will halt nowhere. Long term ownership is cost more. On pitch dark road the light is not sufficient
Bajaj;Dominar400;20 Jan 2021;Akash Abraham;3.8; Tours ;No complaints about the overall performance of the bike.Been on tours, Never faced issues.The only thing is the service that bajaj provides for this bike is terrible.Also, The quality of the spare parts is below average.

Bajaj;Dominar400;2 Aug 2019;Surya Suri;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Its a great bike, I just love it when I ride it,Great for touring Very comfortable, but when it comes to traffic it just drains the fuel, it feels heavy in low speeds if you ride slow for very long, couldn't take a sudden turn in streets. but when it comes to an open road it just excels in every part, taking an overtake is a cake walk. riding comfort, great. just loving this bike
Bajaj;Dominar400;23 Aug 2020;Joel Abe;4.2; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;A best highway tourer I have ever scene. A best vehicle for touring. The double exhaust and the big tank catches the main attraction. It can afford to a middle class family and definitely a value for money.
Bajaj;Dominar400;13 Oct 2020;Hemanta Dutta;4.6; Tours | Occasional Commute ;I loved this bike. My experience is too good with this bike but bajaj showrooms officials behavior is not so good.i hv done 1200kms i have no issues with this bike yet. I m 55kg so bike is so heavy for me.

Bajaj;Dominar400;7 Jul 2019;Sujit Thiru;3.8; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;Just got the Bike. love the features and styling, compared to he previous Generation model. Performance is better than the older generation as the DOHC engine, updated suspension (upside down forks), and double barrel exhaust gives it lot of presence in the road. Comfort, mileage and maintenance is yet to be tested. Will update in a few months of the experience.

I will book the Chetak electric scooter immediately, if the vehicles gets atleast charged within 10 to 15 minutes.Note: If the vehicle is getting charged within 10 to 15 minutes,the battery should not be damaged and Battery life should come as per given warranty card.If above mentioned details are updated for the vehicle,then only the pricing of the vehicle is worthable and selling of the vehicle will be more.Please update as quickly as possible,so more customers will book and me too also.Thanks & Regrads,Nirmal Kumar
Bajaj;Chetak;11 Nov 2020;Pragna Nagendra;5.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;Guys, I recently bought chetak premium, Compared to any other electric this is really awesome where you have a metallic body, Superb charging and gives you more kilometer than what the range says.Recently me and wife went for a long drive of more than 90 km in this and i was happy to see that i still had some 10 to 15 km to spare after i reached home.I have seen electric vehicles saying that you w ill get the kilometers whatever they say in certain conditions and only when an individual rides, But here i was able to get a mileage of more than 90 kms in one charge.Its an eye catcher and everyone on the road keeps on asking about it's features and the cost.Really happy with the performance and would recommend everyone to buy this.

Bajaj;Dominar250;31 Jul 2020;Dinesh A;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Occasional Commute ;It's nearly 2 months I used this bike. It's very aggressive and gives better performance. I can feel vibration on first 3 gears after that, bike shows his real attitude smoothness. Slipper clutch and breaks all are perfect. But gear shifting will be noisy even it can feel by people who is walking on road. Mileage I just got 28 kms/liter, 250cc so it's not disappoint that much. Main drawback is wei ght, you have full road to turn this bike and you always keep one person with you for take reverse. All apart I love my brotherhood
Bajaj;Dominar250;16 Jun 2020;GokulaKannan M;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours ;I loved this bike, very aggressive with sporty performance, heavy and rock solid so that it will be planted in all the speeds, barley no vibration after 3rd gear, very comfortable seating position and extraordinary clutch. Since its slipper clutch, gear shifting will be noisy. Average mileage 30kmpl which i checked neck to neck method in city, yet to check in highway. Suspension are good. Cons are missing gear shift indicator, rear tires are smaller. planning to change the tire to 150/60.

Bajaj;Platina110HGear;23 Jul 2020;Subhendu Halder;5.0; Daily Commute ;I have bought Bajaj platina h gear on 9th June , 2020. Mine is of bs6 varient. Pros of the bike are : 1. cheapest in the segment , 2. Great mileage .I am getting 75+ after first service with normal petrol and 80+ with speed. 3. Nitrox suspension makes the ride smooth - necessary, as I am a daily commuter .4. carb weight is 122 kg which makes the bike stable on 70+ speed.5. the instrument cluster i s digital comes very useful.6. electronic curburrrator is a plus point when it comes to repairing as FI can't be repaired,but replaced.also with electronic curburrrator the bike can be rode with less petrol. Last but not the least the bike looks amazing.Cons : 1. Colour option is only two - blue and burgendy red. 2.Head light is halogen not led. 3. Rear brake has less bite force.

ProsCheap to maintain.Awesome mileage.Good pickup for 110cc bike.Can easily reach the speed of 65kmph.Digital meter is quite good.Disc brake is powerful.Ge ts tubeless tires. Suspension and seat are comfortable.ConsFaced some difficulty to start the vehicle in cold mornings.Tail light doesn't look soo good.

On highway upto 70kmph it's very good, After that engine feels stress as well as a new owner like me.*1000km not done yet, Already giving 65 kmpl mileage, Mostly with a pillion. Good looking except that flat and narrow fuel tank, Though it can hold 10.5 ltr petrol and tank pads look good.* upright seating position is quite comfortab le. Semi knobby tyres makes it different from other 100cc commuters and make it more suitable for bad roads. It is also reinforced with a metal engine guard. Over all1this bike is pocket friendly, Comfortable, and best for me.

Bajaj;Discover110;5 Apr 2020;Vinod Kumar;4.6; Daily Commute ;My biking experience started with Hero Honda Splendour+, 2004. That time it was a good value for money bike. Good design ,nicely built and proper weight to power ratio. I sold it for half the price in 2012. Then I had a natural liking for Bajaj bikes only because my father owned a Bajaj Super in the late 1980's.To my wrath of choosing a Bajaj bike I made up my mind for the Discover series .I wante d to buy a powerful bike with at least 125 cc then but somehow for my style of biking, I preferred a lighter sibling the 100cc. I enjoy all my rides but now I would prefer a bike with adequate power both mid as well as Upper range. You can say I need a bike for both city and touring purpose.

Bajaj;Discover125;20 Aug 2020;Jayakrishnan V;3.8; Daily Commute | Tours ;Good for daily commutes. Don't make high expectations on mileage as its is giving 63 kmpl on the most sensible way of riding with mild throttling on a highway ride. Performance is decent and definitely above par in 125cc segment. Clutch feel is not so good as jerks may happen in using clutyh to start moving the bike on elevations. Gearbox also have a lot of false neutrals to deal with. But if shif ted at above 3000rpm it is smooth and no issues will be faced. Bike has a lot of vibrations post 4000rpm all the way up.My verdict: It is a no nonsense commuter that can go anywhere if mentained properly.

Bajaj;Discover125;14 Jan 2019;Abhishek Nag..;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;It is actually a bajaj discover 150s, but it was not listed, so I had to select the 125. My experience with the 150s has been amazing for every ride. I toured on it, commuted, revd when needed. It cuts through traffic like air. I have replaced its stalk handle bar with a pulsar one, so that adds to maneuver easily too. The suspension is great. Mileage is the trademark of bajaj bikes. The only plac e bajaj needs to work on is their overall quality of the product. The usage of low quality material which reflects in the fit and finish and the ride quality should be overcome. I am sure people would like to pay more and get a better bajaj for themselves.
Bajaj;Discover125;31 Aug 2019;Sudharshan R..;1.0; Daily Commute ;Very bad and never want to buy the bike Bajaj or discover again.

Bajaj;Pulsar135LS;6 Apr 2020;Vaibhav Kochale;2.6; Daily Commute ;a good mileage commuter bike. but has some serious issue with engine. engine gets stalled within 20000km. you will get compression problem more offenly. Even sometimes bike in 5th gear will automatically gets cut off an you cant accelerate or start the machine unless you put some oil in fuel injector place and remove the carbon. It makes really a worst situation on road when you have new machine i n hand and you suffer with such problems....
Bajaj;Pulsar135LS;26 Aug 2020;DEVIL DTS;5.0; Daily Commute ;Best bike under 80k before entry of BS6 norms and market. Its a loss for those who neglected the junior sibling of pulsar series, without analysing its performance. Its was a best power to weight ratio calculated bike, compared to new pulsar 125 equipped with big engine chamber for same regular pulsar 150 chassis Feel bad for those.
Bajaj;Pulsar135LS;7 May 2019;HEAvEn RIdeR;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;I own this bike now for over 9 years n it still gives me the goosebumps when I push the throttle the pickup it has in 135cc class it's unprecedented n the looks it has still turns the head of people.mileage is still the best in class..I get the mileage of 50 still after 9 years before it used to give 60 average but after so many years it has come down which is obvious.13.5 PS of power from 135 cc indian engine is commendable..N mind it the cost of the bike was just 62 k on road when I had purchased it..not like others foreign manufacturers 2 lac 3 lac rupees just for 125 cc engines. .
Bajaj;Pulsar135LS;3 Oct 2020;Saikat Ghosh;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours ;Economic stylish, budget friendly. All pulsar maintain cost little bit high. Top speed of BS 4 model in my hand 107 to 110 KM/hr. But in between 75 to 85 km have vibration problem. Above 85 km i didn't notice any vibration. Light weight, easy for cornering and breaking also good.
Bajaj;Pulsar135LS;9 Dec 2020;MRahul Midya;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have been using it from 3rd feb 2018 and i am very satisfied with this bike.Overall it's a good choice for daily use and long run also.Mainly i used for deily besic, Per day 20km apporx but mileage is still very efficient.Overall it's a very reliable bike.

Bajaj;Pulsar135LS;11 Apr 2019;Vikas Jadhao;3.4; Daily Commute ;Overall experience is not good. Only mileage of the bike is constantly in the range of 60kmpl since 2011. Bike build quality is very poor. Bajaj bikes are good for first five years after that you have to change1parts regularly even piston blocks needs to be replaced after 7 years. Will suggest not to buy

Bajaj;Pulsar180;25 Jul 2020;Mohemmed Asif;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;It was 2013, Me and my brother were looking for a 150cc bike for daily commute and and at that time all we had were Pulsar, Apache, Fz, Fazer, Cb Xtreme, Hunk and Unicorn. Moreover our commute was to college and we needed a snap...so i was convincing my brother and family for bigger bikes like pulsar 220, R15 and 200NS but effeciency was also concerned where petrol price hike was an issue back the n and till now! lol So on keeping all factors...we were close with 3- Pulsar 180, Pulsar 220 and Apache 180 (hero twins were not sure on production and availability). And eyes closed we've rejected Apache for vibrations as soon as we first test ridden it as our daily commute was about 80-100 kms. So it was within the same brand and with efficiency concerned we had no further option rather than sticking with 180. We were already a fan of Pulsar for its looks and features. firstly illuminated switch gears, auto turn off indicators and DC lighting. which made it standout from the bikes back then. First Impression: From the first sight the naked styling with clip-ons , Fatter front and rear tires with chunky forks it looks kinda strong addition to twin pilot lamps(Wolf eyed) styling with Speedlines vinyl(half black) was quiet impressive.Build: The bike is slightly heavy as it's on 220s chassis and Metal fuel tank, heavy exhaust which makes hefty and the Fit and finish is average causing skeeching noises and till 3 years there were no rust signs but the paint of black parts like engine block, cylinder fins, exhaust, wheels were poor which is visible to naked eye itself. But other than that the metal body doesnt make any issues.. with proper maintenance the bike keeps on shining and its been 7 years haven't seen the paint peel off...infact paint quality is still great even on plastic panels. And the bike is quite silent in regular speeds without buzz,only in top end the foot pegs and seats get the buzz. Ergonomics: At the beginning i felt the bike was heavy for my age which is common but later was in love with the ergonomics, especially the comfortable not so low clip-ons and back slung pedals the position is spot on for long rides. Also pillion seat was big enough and equally as spacious like 150 and not bad. But fixation of ladies footrest(saree) is not possible as suspension is taller in 180. Only care to be taken is when pillion gets backpack, the extended plastic end gets scratched easily. Overall the position is good for both city and Highway conditions with upright torso and lean back pedals.Seats are a tad hard comparing to any bike. long rides were never delightful with these, hard cushion makes it sturdy in city conditions but for long rides sore b**t is for sure. And wind blast is vigorous at even 80 kmph which bike does it in ease and unless you tug in, doing high speeds is like a pullback! Performance: Having 180 is surely advantage where no 150 commuters messes around...overall performance compared to Apache 180, Pulsar 180 is not close to Apache 180 where the acceleration is better in apache with shorter gearing but pulsar shines in Topspeed and Highway cruising with ease maintaining triple digits without any vibrations. The additional weight of pulsar is also visible in acceleration. However the Torque spread is from 4000rpm above that which the bike pulls straight to 9000rpm and after that the juice fades which is limited with Cdi to 10000rpm. Transmission is something that was hectic in pulsars back then with sluggish gear shifts which usually makes you held up in neutral while shifting from 1st to second and engaging 5th gear from 4th was quiet a task. Clutch is not as light as japanese but still Lighter than any Royal Enfields back then. The Engine is air cooled and does the job with no issues but i havent risked it longer than 100 kms. Took a break for every 100kms in long rides. And the bike came up without any fuss even on topend. Clocked 52k kms till now and reached topspeed of 154 kmph.(not sure may be bajajs speedo error) haven't checked in GPS but sure that'll be close.Braking: one thing that im impressed is with the brakes.. with soft suspension in front and heavy front end makes the bikes brakes so confident inspiring without locking front wheels and bigger disc offers decent feel in the lever. One thing old pulsar 180 model missed is Rear disc. Mine got only Drum at rear which usually locksup in solo and not that confident inspiring with pillion. even on locking the wider tires(MRFs) gives enough confident to ride hard. the softer front suspension helps in not locking up front wheels but nose dive is heavy and unless you have straight roads for stopping surely needs skills. while cornering definitely Pulsar is not composed or even confident inspiring like Apache and 200NS , Pulsar 180 feels kinda bouncy and usually the exhaust scraps down in right and foot pegs in left. But where Pulsar shines is in highways with add on weight and long wheelbase the stability is unmatched, it can do Triple digits all day long without making the rider giving a shock unless you change the seat(bahoth hard)! Also the adjustable nitrox only softens and stiffens up rear end while the most important is front suspension which is miss. Milege: When ridden soft and not so aggressively the figures keepup above 40 kmpl and in highway it stretches to 45 kmpl and in average i get around 42kmpl, With Huge 15 litres tank the Range easily 500 kms. Overall: Pulsar 180 is a bike above 150cc commuters and does the work in its own style and 18 years of legacy in Indian motorcycling. Especially that snap over the 150s and 160 cc's like Apache 160, Fz and Fazer is definitely worth it. Now the Pulsar 180F is only available with semi-fairing and not in naked street, which is very much needed especially for that windblast in cruising speeds. Its the bike that's not for maniac riding and amature riding, its the one for city limit crossing commuters conquering both city and highway conditions, who rides like a commuter and want a bit fun occasionally. That brand and classic Wolf pack styling is always Nostalgic.
Bajaj;Pulsar180;22 Dec 2020;Miryabelli K..;2.6; Daily Commute ;I am satisfied with the pickup that's it, It max don't support a riding comfort, I suggest you people to have the better bike with the best seating position, As for mileage there should be no worries bcoz now a days people done have much concentration on mileage due to all the upgraded bikes are of the same mileage with 1 to 5 km variation.So please think twice and select a bike make sure to have a test ride if they they refuse to give a test drive then simply avoid that showroom or the specific bije.
Bajaj;Pulsar180;16 Apr 2020;Lalthanhawla..;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours ;I had bought this bike Pulsar 180 DTSI in the beginning of the year 2005 from the first owner. The first owner want to sell because the new model having an alloy wheel was just arrived. Making a trip more than 100000 kms, my engine still remain intact. The cost of genuine part is not too much, the performance and reliability is good. I used it to make a trip in the rugged and slippery roads of the hilly areas, I do recommended and it will still be my first choice bike for my needs
Bajaj;Pulsar180;15 Oct 2020;Dilip Patel;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;This is simply the best bike.I own this since 2013 and have completed 63000 kms.The bike still has no performance issues as such.The maintenance cost is quite low or rather, I would say it's a maintenance free bike.The fuel efficiency comes roughly between 42 to 45kms per litre which is quite good as compared to any other 180cc bikes.Also, Have taken this bike for long tours (2000 kms) and it has never caused any problems during and after the ride.
Bajaj;Pulsar180;12 Jun 2020;Sushantu Aga..;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Occasional Commute ;ITS A GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY BIKE IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD PULSAR 220 AT THIS PRICE POINT YO CAN EASILY DO INTERSTATE COMMUTE WITH THE PERFORMANCE BIKE OFFER YOU MILEAGE IS ALSO IN DECENT NO. FIGURES AS I ACHIEVE TILL 50KMPL ON HIGHWAY AT THE SPEED BETWEEN 80-85 KMPH PLUS POINT IS ITS FUEL TANK CAN STORE FUEL UPTO 18LT. THAT IS MORE THE SUFFECIENT FOR LONG HIGHWAY RUNS
Bajaj;Pulsar180;13 Oct 2020;Richie John;4.6; Daily Commute ;I have been using it for 5 years and still the performance is AT ITS BEST. It all depends on how you maintain your bike, I have been till Rajasthan all the way from Chennai no issues, they say fuel tank is 15 ltrs however mine holds 18ltrs. After the recent servicing from gobmpr and amazing service the bike runs around 127KM/hr and does not shake.
Bajaj;Pulsar180;24 Dec 2018;Khaliq Girach;4.6; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;It‚Äôs been a hack of ride with it, that‚Äôs for sure. I used to study in the next city and visited home every week. You don‚Äôt buy a pulsar for it‚Äôs mileage, you buy it for the performance you get from it. It‚Äôs definitely higher than 150 but not much lower than 220. It was the best around the time I bought it in the year 2008. I believe not much has changed since in it. Modified a bit though around 2 years ago. It was time to make some changes. I was hoping to get pulsar cs400 but the bike never made it to the market. It had all the muscles that I want in a bike. Sadly, we‚Äôll never see it again. Overall, my experience was satisfactory.
Bajaj;Pulsar180;11 May 2020;Soutik Rakshit;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Bike is awesome... Rode it about 70000 kms done short rides...

Bajaj;Pulsar180;30 Dec 2018;Vipin Nair;3.4; Daily Commute | Tours ;My Current bike is Pulsar 180 which require frequent maintenance and the cost is too much. Every time I need to spend around 3000 to 4000 and last but not least few days back I had to spend around 10000 for replacement kits and other spare parts as well. It's not comfortable for a ride like more than 100 km as the seating is not comfortable. Once it reached the speed of 90km/hr the entire vehicle starts vibrating and you can feel it in your brake pedal.

TVS;ApacheRTR160;20 May 2019;Yash Gupta;3.4; Daily Commute | Tours ;Hello I have purchased tvs apache rtr 160 4v fi 3 moths back and i am writing this review after riding the bike around 2500 kms.1. Buying experience 1.Its good i rate 2/5. During the sales tvs company claims 60 kmpl is the mileage and average mileage is around 50 .But you hardly get 35-40 mileage which could be worst if you are expecting mileage and a daily commuter better don‚Äôt buy if not if ha ve to spend a lot only on filling the petrol 2.Riding experience 1.Its good i rate 4/5 3.Details about looks, performance etc.1.Looks : it has a great look which has convinced me to buy this bike. 2.Performance is moderate on the performance of this bike . It has a great engine power but worst mileage. I hardly get 35-40 mileage which is most worst part of this bike. 4. Servicing and maintenance.During the sales they don‚Äôt mention on the servicing and maintenance part but this bike has to be filled with a special synthetic oil which costs around 700 per filling which is double the cost of general oil . 5.Pros and cons 1.Pros : good performance in terms of engine power 2.Cons : worst mileage hardly 35 kmpl and high maintenance than a general bikes in this segment.

There is always issue with some of the other part of this bike. Disc Break Issue, Engine Issue, Losing Pick-up Suddenly in the middle of highway (which could be very fatal), Clutch Issue and everything above all replacement of silencer.

As it is in running-in period I haven"t pushed it hard( maximum 5-6k RPM and 60-65kmph) good acceleration(pick-up) mileage right now is approx 40-43kmpl and engine is refined, no harsh vibration only slight buzz at around 6k RPM and engine heats a bit in traffic but as it is a new engine it"s acceptable. Seating comfort is good for rider and pillion, my mother had no issues, braking is firm on front brake a bit progressive on rear it will get better after 300-400km, tires provide good grip. A fun to ride machine tvs did a good job.
TVS;ApacheRTR160;2 Nov 2019;Saeed Ibrahim;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;Tvs has matured a lot from where they used to be 10 years back. This bike is just a perfect example of that.

Perfect handling... Great stability... Best seat cushioning, good suspension (after adjust), good braking.. Good light visibility.. Good Pillion comfort, next level overall performance..
TVS;ApacheRTR160;18 Jul 2020;Abdhesh Singh;3.4; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours;it is very good I don't know about mileage but I think it just ok power is also good but I feel it should be equipped with rear abs disk. because sometimes it's rear wheel is get looked while driving. it is a race oriented bike so comfort level is little bit lower side.
TVS;ApacheRTR160;7 May 2020;Throttleresp..;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Good performance Gppd bike for riding more than 500 kms per day if on tours4 months ago i bought this n I'm really very happy with the right choiceBest hybrid bikeIf required more capacity you may go for 2004v its, the big brother of 160 4vN ofcourse be the best as 1604v
TVS;ApacheRTR160;4 Nov 2018;Aakarshan Kumar;2.2; Daily Commute ;This is a worst product. No brand value. Its maintenance is very high. It"s good to avoid buying All the bikes coming from tvs company will be similar to other products, but this company will not have quality . They have no own design. Their purpose is to steal design from other companiesFor instance Jupiter similar activa ntorq similar dio Radeon Copy it without changing itHero Splendor Let"s say a lot more.Besides this company. There are also experiences that have stolen other product stolen case
TVS;ApacheRTR160;24 Jan 2020;Chandrashekh..;4.2; Daily Commute;Performance of this bike is better than FZ-S FI. Apache is well known for its pick up. Mileage is slightly less than that of FZ.

TVS;ApacheRTR160;24 Nov 2019;Atul Sharma;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;it's a beast very smooth engine even at high Rpm no vibration. breaking is good maintenance cost is reasonable and it's mileage is oh my god very good many times at 70 kmph i got 49-50. and it's pickup is like as rocket..... best bike from TVS i love it..

TVS;ApacheRTR160;21 Mar 2019;Mohammed Sannan;4.6; Daily Commute ;Bike is really good, but tvs service center people are not good.

TVS;ApacheRTR160;21 Jul 2020;Bhuvanesh Na..;3.8; Daily Commute ;Hello there, I have been using this bike for the past 2 years. Let me first tell you about the pros of this bike. Performance is at its best, Mileage same as before 40 kmpl, The top speed is 121kmph but vibrations are inevitable. The brakes are ok but not good, The maintenance is quite good. Now i will tell you about the cons, In week 2 of ownership the carburetor wass blocked and petrol started t o leak through the holes in the silencer, I have never seen such kind of problem, towed it to the service center and they fixed the issue after 2 days.After 1 year of ownership I heard rattling noise in the silencer which was annoying when you stand in the traffic, went to the service center and he said it is a manufacturing defect which will be replaced under warranty. In January 2020, I faced a major problem in the middle of the traffic, The bike stopped automatically. I was trying to kick start but not worth. The bike felt like dead. There was sufficient petrol in the tank and the battery was also good. after trying to start the bike for 1 hour, it started and again dead. With so much frustration I called the service center and told the problem, They arranged to tow the bike to the nearest service center. They saw the bike and said there's was some problem with the coil but we cannot find which coil. They took 1 week to find and replace the coil which is replaced under warranty. This bike have some manufacturing defects. The gear transmission is not smooth specifically while reducing the gear. You can hear loud thud sound from the gear box. Sometimes the the neutral gear will be struck, you have to move the bike little and try to 1st gear. The ride quality is good at the end.

TVS;ApacheRTR180;19 Aug 2019;Akash Rana;4.2; Daily Commute;Apache Rtr 180 is definitely a good commuter bike. It is basicaly designed for city riding. Its engine is torqy and power starts to build up right from 3000 rpm and goes upto 7000. Its top end has very poor pull as engine only generates noise. Vibrations are very much felt at every point on bike such as footpegs , side view mirrors and visor . Nothing can be done to avoid it.Seats are comfortable but start feeling itchy after 40 - 50 kms of ride.Mileage in cities is around 40 - 42 KMPl and on highways increases upto 45-48 KMPl.stock tyres are not that good , provide less grip on wet road.Its maintenance is cheap untill you have to replace any of mechanical parts. Normal service will cost around 575‚Çπ under free service .1025 ‚Çπ paid service.for 2018 model.
TVS;ApacheRTR180;19 Apr 2019;Mahendra Soren;3.0; Daily Commute ;Mine is an ABS variant. The RTR needs a lot of development in terms of comfort, stability and braking. The seat offers very unpleasant feeling during driving through rough surface. At above 70 kmph of speed, the bike shivers. The stability is tremendously disrupted during conering. Lastly, the most important part of driving : braking. It feels like requiring a lot of effort in bringing about contr ol over the bike in emergency. The ABS needs to be replaced with a next gen one. The existing variant is not so accomplished. I have been regularly commuting since January 2014 and I have faced problems with ABS 6-7 times altogether. May a times, even while driving, it stops working and resumes after some time or engine restart. With so many complaints said, speed is the only factor on the positive side which has fastened me for such a long time. Otherwise, its rivals such as Bajaj Pulsar, Yamaha Faser and Honda CBR are are better at these points at cheaper price range. So, the company needs to give attention on the above matters in order to keep pace on the race.
TVS;ApacheRTR180;10 Jan 2021;Nikoloi;5.0; Daily Commute ;I am really satisfied with these bike all I want is few upgrades in these bike for example USD Suspension, Mono Sock, wide Swing Arm, Rare tyre atleast 130, and at last 6th gear may be not for direct selling but a choice for upgrades which will make a bike looks more muscular and safe for top speed ridder since 180 has no upgrade since 2012 in looks. So There fore I hope and pray that TVS will be kind enought to note down my demands Thank You Lots of love From Kanu Kalai From Tripura
TVS;ApacheRTR180;11 Jul 2020;Vijay Kumar;5.0; Leisure Rides;Very light and full control in riding. Instant pick up make it more reliable. If someone use it single hand then you never loss its feel alike JUST NEWI am using it since Oct 2015. From my point of view, a customer who buy it I suggest you that when you buy it you ride it full speed and long run with two persons in order to make it more efficient for future (please ensure traffic rule and own safe ty). And light service every two months on 1000kmWith regards Vijay Kumar Nain

TVS;Jupiter;28 Feb 2020;Tejas Dash;3.4; Daily Commute;Writing this review After 1 Year of riding. I though it would be great to share my experience. 1. Mileage - 44 Km/Litre(This is guaranteed, I have atleast 50+ reading average data. If you ride on 50 to 60 Speed without changing speed too quickly. 2. PICK UP - Quick accelerator is not that good.Honda activa is better and Yamaha Fascino is even better. 3. Seat is larger, But weight capacity is not t hat great. 4. BATTERY - This is Important. TVS provide two kinds of battery for Jupiter. EXIDE and AMCO. I had AMCO battery and it given trouble within 8 months of use. then I changed it as it was on warranty. But Guys, It might be a manufacturing issue for my scooter battery, but You should demand for a EXIDE battery while purchasing a Jupiter, They will give it easily. EXIDE is a much better battery than any battery on earth. Amaron battery is No.2 in the race! If You are unlucky, then anything can give trouble, But if your luck favor, Then AMCO will give maximum 2.5 to 3 yrs while EXIDE will give upto 6 years of self life. 5. COLOR- Not many free color options, But in Classic range, there are quite lovely colors. But be informed that, in Both basic and Classic models, Engine is same, Only outer body look is different.
TVS;Jupiter;11 Feb 2020;Tanmay Trivedi;4.2; Daily Commute;I bought TVS Jupiter standard yesterday for my father for daily commutation purpose for about 15-20km per day. So today I checked the mileage of TVS Jupiter in city as well as on highway at a maximum speed of 50km/hr . I drove in eco mode only . Average which I got is : 160 km in 3.07 litre ( With two person weighing 155kg ) Nearly 52 Km/litreAdvantages of buying Jupiter :1) 12inch wheels which pr ovide good comfort for long drive as well as less shaking in potholes. 2) Suspension system is very good far better than activa. 3) Riding Position is also comfortable as handle is place near to your body. 4) Performance : Better Pickup. Good for highway ride Decent mileage 5) More under seat Storage 6) Good leg space Cons : 1) Look wise not so stylish. 2) Seat is small for two healthy person3) Seat cushion is too soft. 4) Pillion seating position is uncomfortable.
TVS;Jupiter;25 Dec 2020;Sree 5547;1.4; Occasional Commute ;I exchanged my 8 year old honda aviator and bought a jupiter.Worst decision i made.Quality of materials itself too bad compared to aviator, After one year the screws used inside the meters are rusted, Means those are of normal cheap screws and not of automobile quality.While changing oil the bolt under the oil tank got damaged, To fix that i spend 1500, Since while opening that something else got broken.In mechanics words these things only happen to jupiter.As a summary from my experience with jupiter and aviator: mileage is 30 to 40 max in town, Pillion ride is very uncomfortable, Riding comfort is worse than aviator, Balance is not good, Quality of materials is too too bad.I won't recommend this at all.
TVS;Jupiter;24 Nov 2020;Subhasish Guha;3.0; Occasional Commute ;Bought zx model one month back from m/s shaw auto centre, Titagarg, Wb.They could not inform me about receipt of the numberplate though they promised at the time of purchase.On being called, They have informed that the same is lying with them and i may visit their office to get it fitted.In addition, They have also asked me to pay rs.100/- being fitting charge which i was told at the time of purch ase to be not required as they have already charged rs.500/- for the number plate.The odometer is to be checked as it appears that the same is moving very fast.The sales employees were cooperative during purchase of the scooty.Further review will be given after a few service done.S.Guha.
TVS;Jupiter;20 Jul 2019;Bk Lkshy;4.2; Occasional Commute ;Don"t know why people complain about Jupiter mileage. Maybe they can be right but for me, it is giving me exact 62kmpl mileage in mix conditions (1 year/ 3000 km). If I ride single. My experience with my old Jupiter is very bad (especially mileage) that was mostly used by my brother. My suggestions don"t let the belt loose. Use kick start, and let it warm for 1 min during the first start of each d ay. Use linear speed. Don"t accelerate too quickly. Don"t go over 55kmpl if not needed. Note: Sometimes it just stops and won"t start even though everything is fine. Actually, all Jupiter comes with a little manufacturing defect that is all the wires of break and other things come from the right side of the handle .So, when you turn handles they get chocked and self-start and other things won"t work. Just give a good twist to the handle left to right. Wait, and it will start again. And yes, if you want more performance then go for ntoque. Although, I don"t have one.
TVS;Jupiter;19 Jul 2020;Raymond Brag..;5.0; Daily Commute ;A true scooter where you can rely on. Good comfort, good head light, suspension, mileage and convenient features. Only drawback of this 2015 Jupiter model is it's brakes. They are not that good, but they are ok. Engine: whatever TVS makes is done with their racing experience n their DNA. Engine is so smooth n torque. It's a scooter of a Royal Enfield motor cycles torque class. I enjoy riding this scooter as if I m going for a race on mountains. No potholes or bad roads can stop you. Just glides over... N all metal body.
TVS;Jupiter;23 Nov 2020;Khalid Kamaal;3.8; Daily Commute ;I found the jupiter to be a better riding but less refined version of the active.As far as ride and handling are concerned the jupiter doesn't disappoint and has class leading ride, Handling, And braking.The disc brake version is the emperor of stopping power in its class.The paint job, Fit and finish are top notch and if the jupiter could somehow go 10 kmpl more than it does and do away with the slight buzz in the handlebars that comes in when pushed hard? it would be the best buy in its class.
TVS;Jupiter;22 Oct 2020;Dayananda N;1.8; Daily Commute ;Recently i purchased a new tvs jupiter scooter in solar tvs bangaloreassuming that it gives zyada fayeda.But after using i realised that this is a no fayeda scooter.Maintenance cost of this scooter is very high.Since the scooter used with an ideal speed not exceeding 40km/h, It had a worst mileage of 30 to 35 km/ltr.It consumes more fuel.Better to go on honda scooters.Committed a blunder mistake b y purchasing this.Please don't buy this worst vehicle.
TVS;Jupiter;1 Aug 2019;Mohammad Salah;3.8; Daily Commute ;I have only one issue with it since I bought it. That is, the vibration you get when you ride it around 30-40 kmph speed. When you increase speed more than 50kmph you don"t feel anything. But in city you can't go at 50kmph . It is very annoying vibration/rubbing of something with tyre but service centre people don"t consider it as problem. They just don"t accept that there"s vibration in my vehicl e.Also the battery doesn't last even one year. Poor from TVS. You have to wait at least 20 days to get new battery in warranty. They don"t provide temporary battery and ask you to manage with Kick start.Really poor after sales service from TVS. You made a good scooter but don't have quality people who understand the vehicle and can service it.Request TVS to hire knowledgeable people else people will stop buying your vehicles
TVS;Jupiter;19 Jul 2020;Hydmoto Vlogs;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;Best suited for short trips to the market for groceries n to buy essentials. Basically there are no complains and is a good competitor to the Activa. This is much more liter and easily drivableCan be driven by both men & women. Braking is adequate. With the seat height at 175mm and just a little above 100kgs this is ideal for all short and medium height riders 5.2 feet to 5.8feet without any troub les.Cons : nothing as such
TVS;Jupiter;11 Nov 2019;Legend Don;3.4; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours;Jupiter is a good vehicle but after using it for much time its mileage reduces ,engine sound increases,it becomes harder than smooth riding experience,some problems with digital metre ex.petrol will be shown correctly. & maintenance cost is 600 ( service charge).I ride at 85km/h speed & my avg is at 60km/h ,so I get 40kmpl mileage.Advantages:StyleBig tyresGood mileage if u ride at economy.(50 to 5 5kmpl).
TVS;Jupiter;14 Jul 2020;Ronald Agnel;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;I got mileage of 35-40kms I used it for long rides too.. Continuous full throttle 80-100 kms rides.. Max speed achieved was 82kmph. Jupiter is smooth at all levels of speed. The economy and power switch helps a lot to gain good mileage. Bases on Delhi I have rode it in Mumbai and Banglore as well. Good for off roading too. It was my first scooter and it fulfilled all my wishes and expectations.
TVS;Jupiter;11 Nov 2020;Autobeast India;5.0; Daily Commute ;The updated version gets the all new led headlamps even in the base model which is priced at rs75000 on road delhi.The way it accelerates in power mode is awesome.I have jupiter zx which gets the charging socket too.The instrument cluster has became digital+analog which gives an all new feel.Design has not changed much, But that's how we feel the jupiter, A perfect city commuter.
TVS;Jupiter;28 May 2019;Rahul Rawat;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;I have been using Jupiter for more than 2 years. I am quite happy with it.Mileage - Good almost same as Activa~45 Km/pl in city conditions.Comfort- Much better than Activa 110 cc due to better suspension and seats.Build Quality- Good build quality.Riding Experience- Only 1 Kg lighter than Active but feels like at least 20 kg lighter. Handling is good. Maintenance - I haven"t visited any local mech anic for any issue. I just visit the service center for regular service.After Sales Service- TVS is an awarded brand by JD Power for excellent service that most customer also talk.Best thing is you can start your scooter while sitting on the seat like bikes which is not present in most of scooters.
TVS;Jupiter;10 Oct 2020;Kedar Kudekar;4.2; Daily Commute ;Actually mine is TVS Wege, but could not find that option on this site to tick. Typically for 10-km a day city running for dropping kids to school and incidental work within the city limits, so not much running. Good scooter, liked the center balancing feature the most. Have run for 10 years and it has just started giving some maintenance troubles. Ran smoothly till now.
TVS;Jupiter;15 Apr 2019;Raj Viru;1.8; Daily Commute ;I Have Bought TVS Jupiter Classic from Kaleido Motors near Pheonix Mall, Bangalore. This is not giving Mileage only. We get only 30- 35 Km/Ltr . Never buy this if u want mileage. Also the Quality is not good like Honda Activa. I have both these my sister has Honda. So i can make the comparision by using. Activa is far better is all aspects. The service centre also very rude and wont respond or fix the problems in my Jupiter. I asked to fix the mileage but they could not. And also the chrome mirrors are of bad quality which they have provided. DABBA .. Dont get cheated from them Be aware. Less Mileage and Low Quality- TVS Jupiter - Service People dont even care for your problems.Dnt Buy
TVS;Jupiter;12 Apr 2019;Srinivas Kayyur;1.8; Daily Commute;I own a Jupiter TN66 T1360, purchased 2 years ago in coimbatore. I bought this after test driving Jupiter, Access, Activa and finalized Jupiter due to low weight, thinking my spouse can use it. Reality is she never used it. The driving1experience is pathetic and very poor. The vehicle is worse after 60kmph, generates loud sound and vibrates. They might use simple gear box which1is pathetic 2. Poor seat design, and its a pain in Bottom. 3. Riding comfort is poor and feels like driving a toy bike I bought SUZUKI Access and its a fantastic bike for riding comfort. The scooter becomes silent when you speed up and its a fantastic experience. The seat is broad and very comfortable.
TVS;Jupiter;23 Oct 2020;Snatch;2.6; Daily Commute ;I have real bad experience with jupiter. My accelerator cable broke within just 1 month 13 days of buying, also side lights are sometimes not working. Real disappointment. I regret buying tvs jupiter. Should have better gone for Activa..

TVS;Jupiter;30 Oct 2018;Clyde Fernandes;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours ;after riding for 80000+ kms i can tell that this is a best scooty in market. reason being its heavy stable on highway,no vibration at all ,better fuel economy with power and eco mode very comfortable for even three people,boot space has no comparison at all. u can literally store full size helmet n few other stuff the best part is long tyres which just gives u confidence in cornering n bike does n ot slip or skit on wet surface and a smooth engine about the negative :the brakes r less effective n the maintenance is lil higher on this scooty which is fine.

TVS;Jupiter;13 Aug 2019;Vinoth Thang..;3.8; Daily Commute ;Bought this for family use. but it is a bit heavy for womens to use. Mileage is average, gives around 45 to 55 ltrs. Maintenance cost is low. The seat is very hard, so it gives all kinds of pains in long rides. Drum brakes needs lots of maintenance, During rainy rides or when applying sudden brakes you should be extra careful. so better go for other options like single disc and double disc.

TVS;NTORQ125;2 Dec 2019;Dilip Kumar;5.0; Daily Commute ;I am 6.2 height from Bangalore, For TVS Ntorq( I'll refer this as bike hereafter), I have altered bike seat to match my height, bike balance is really good after seat alteration, Mileage in city for my rough ride (30-100kmph speeds)used to get around 35kmpl. when I travel to my hometown, I got mileage around (30kmpl) when I ride @105 kmph, 42 kmpl mileage with average speed of 75 kmph & when I rid e in economy like 55 kmph, i got 55 kmpl mileage. So, Mileage depends on how much speed I ride. My ride is for 200 KMS for my home town, went around 4 times to my hometown town, I never stopped my bike until I reached home, I usually fill shell power petrol when I ride long distances, I'll suggest it to everyone otherwise bike will be heated up with normal petrol.I bought my bike in EMI without knowing which financier to choose, simply went through the Showroom peoples choice & didn't knew who is financing my bike until my bike got delivered to me ,though it is not a bad choice, I believe we must be knowing that minimum information to compare if we had any better choices in financing our bike.TVS Service is really good, costed me around 1100 rupees for first 4 free services with oil change 2 times, this is best compared to other Brands.Bike not punctured even once.my daily commute is for 10 KMS a day with up and down to office usually takes 10 minutes to reach.Accessories I have bought guards for 2000 rupees, which I regret,I think there's no need of them, it really spoils the bike look. If you want to buy, then buy black color one, don't go for steel color.I have bought a new bolt & nut, cost 10 rupees for exhaust/ silencer when I missed them while riding due to bike rubbling except that I never spent any other money other than petrol.Bike is awesome for it's Torque & power, I felt like no bike can compete with this NTorq.Instrument cluster is also very useful & is not available with others in this range.So, go for itIn a year, ride is 7500 KMS and it is great that this bike is up to my expectations
TVS;NTORQ125;18 Apr 2020;Ravindra Nag;5.0; Daily Commute ;I think the NTorq is the best 125cc scooter in the Indian market. It's a perfect balance between the conventional 'going to buy sth' scooter experience and performance-oriented motoscooter segment. It can do jobs of both worlds. I'm getting a decent mileage of 40-45 kmpl which is not bad and is compensated by it's unique design n look. The performance is great, churns out 9.4 PS of power and can e asily reach speeds of 90kmph. It can touch the magic 100 too. The torque provided by the motor is amazing. Overtakes are pretty easy. Rider comfort is great. The suspension is stiffer than the Activa or Access but it's not as stiff as Aprilia. It handles the roughness of Indian roads with ease. The pillion experience is better than any other scooter in the market. It's a fun scooter, easy to maneuver and park. Don't get me started on the first in segment bluetooth connectivity. It's really helpful (atleast to boast about). The navigation works like a charm. It shows the last parked location making it easier to search your ntorq among the crowd. Talking about the underseat storage, it has 22 ltrs of boot space but it's design makes it difficult to fit a full-faced helmet. You can fit a modular helmet just fine. The 12 inch tyres provide a great grip, even in the rain. The front disc provides a good bite but the rear drum doesn't do the job well. You get performance and comfort in a single package. Lastly, the quality of the switches is top notch (just TVS things). Now the maintenance and service center efficiency varies from place to place. In Bhubaneswar, it's time taking but satisfactory service.
TVS;NTORQ125;3 Oct 2020;Purab Gusain;3.0; Daily Commute ;I bought a new scooty of the month of july 13. After some time, there was a mild sound in Scooty. After which I took Scooty to the service center. Whose information I had given to the service center during the first service. After 1 week of service suddenly this noise increased. After that, I called the service center again andtold them all the problems. They asked us to bring a scooty service cen ter. The next morning, while going to the service center, Scootystopped on the road (that can be the cause of accidents because a truck coming from the backside.We survived that day) After which I all them and they took Scooty to the service center. Where it turns out that Scooty's engine has a problem (manufacturing defects). Which he talked about fixing(September 14). So Now wefear to repeat it again. I already report to TVS customer care they give me 48 hours to call from there technical team but it's more the 3 days no phone call. and no respond of mail.
TVS;NTORQ125;12 Sep 2020;Shakkir Moha..;3.0; Daily Commute ;I'm shakkir cp , daily user (6000km) Using race edition before I buy I hoped tvs solved all the problem of 1st model but still the problems there .I know this is the best performer and stability with handling.Poor build quality and comfort OK. After 3rd service claimed 37km/L before 41km/L Handle position is not good making pain to hand handle bar changed 2times and fine . next vibration, higher i nitial vibration in the scooter segment Normally the problem starting after 15000 km with normal ride Here started 2500km after clutch greasing problem not solved.2nd type vibration facing economy speed (40-55km)and the problem mentioned 3rd service but not solved .Next one common issue starting problem want to hold 4or5 sec self to start and using kicker after 24 kick to start Service response not good ,not bad.All is manufacturing defect.TVS still not solving any issue I don't know why?
TVS;NTORQ125;12 Nov 2020;Dewang Wagh;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;I've been using the first gen ntorq 125 (2018 model), Having a very satisfied ownership experience, Power is just the best, Its instant and in controllable manner.Easy for new young riders.It is the best touring scooter in its segment, It just glides on the highways, Thanks to its weight scooter feels well planted on high speeds (80-90) cross winds does not move the scooter a bit !.Since i've used it more on highways i have returned economy of fab 47-50 kmpl, In city you can expect till 40 kmpl.The only down side of this scooter is it needs to be serviced at least thrice a year, That is 1500-2000 per service (depending on work ), I will recommend tvs annual service policy it will save some money.If we didn't service it timely, The scooter tend to have squeaky panels and loose body parts.Otherwise it is the best scooter over all !.
TVS;NTORQ125;27 Dec 2019;Irshad Gorak..;4.2; Daily Commute;Long Term Review :Using it since October :Pros :1) Performance : Best in segment, no vibrations, stable and smooth throttle response.2) Exhaust : Stands out from the crowd with its bassy sound.3) Design : Looks Ultra Modern and has huge road presence.4) Utility : 22L bootspace, Front Hangers, LED DRLs, Out of the seat petrol inlet, this is a real practical scooter.5) Console : Instrument Cluster i s way ahead of its class infact its similar to the one on Apache 200 4V. It has Bluetooth connectivity and GPS support.6) Tyres : With 12 inch alloy wheels and thickness same as that of Apache 160 tyres are beefy and sporty.7) Braking : Braking is confidence inspiring due to SBS and Disc.Cons :1) Mileage : I drive in congested areas of Delhi with huge traffic and I get around 30 kmpl, on City Roads and highways expect a mileage of 40+.
TVS;NTORQ125;12 Nov 2020;Kumar S;1.4; Daily Commute;Hii.I bought tvs ntorq vehicle a week ago and face a different kind of issue, On my 1st day 1- oil leakage in engine 2- charce bend3- vibration in fronti told all this complaint he tried to solve it did not happen later he said, Take the vehicle now come after 2days mechanic are busy.After 2days he said will solve all this when you come for 1st service.Some how convinced.On my 1st service did not do anything just water wash oil change he gave back the vehicle.I said you have done nothing, He said leave your bike tomorrow for half a day i'll fix everything and i'll give.I agreed same thing happened same oil leakage again.Only mudgard problem was solved and now he's telling that give a day time i'll fix everything.So i request you all please do not by this vehicle and service is also worst.
TVS;NTORQ125;25 Sep 2019;Yadukrishnan..;4.2; Daily Commute ;TVS has made a compact sports scooter compatible for Indian conditions.After covering about 1500 km I can say that the engine is refined, provides a meaty mid range which makes city rides a delight.the suspension set up is balanced between comfort and sportiness and the bigger and wider tyres compliments this.Front disc provides ample bite which when combined with cbs provides an overall precise b reaking.Fuel economy can vary according to riding styles. However maintaining an avg economy speeds ( 40 to 55 ) can return around 45 KMPL Now like every other product some things could"ve been improved1 Headlamps are not powerful enough..wouldve been nice to have LEDs2 Plastic quality couldve been improved3 fuel lid controls at the ignition key slot would have been convinient
TVS;NTORQ125;2 Jan 2020;Y Shiva;2.6; Daily Commute;after completing 12000 km in 11 months am sharing my review if us r looking for stylish scooter this one you can choos talking about pros I love the bike sound and second is engine performance, first Bluetooth instrumental cluster in scooter we I ever seen, coming to cons the biggest mistake which I made by choosing this bike is having worst build quality, lots of vibrations in front mudguard and in instrumental cluster that sound make realy irritate me, the company claim 47kmpl milage but it's around 33kmpl , this bike is made of complete fibre body. I suggest if you r looking for stylish and milage scooter go for jupiter grandi edition though ntorq is best selling scooter I don't like this and I suggest jupiter with best build quality thank for reading my review
TVS;NTORQ125;2 Dec 2019;Vedang Deshmukh;5.0; Daily Commute ;It's just an amazing scooter in the 125cc segment. It has got all you need. A GPS Navigation when your lost. A Caller ID. Good Performance. For me the Bike races from 0-60 in under 7 secs. The Top speed I've been on this is 109km/hr. Even at height speeds the bike is stable without any vibration (if proper time to time service of the vehicle is done). Spares are a bit costly but that's ok as compa red to it's performance üòâ. The only advice I would give you for this bike is, when you go out for service go only to the authorized service centers cause the bike is complex and maybe new to some mechanics so maybe they can need it up. The fibre parts gets loose at times which are fixed during service at free of cost. Overall I would give 9/10 for this scooter.
TVS;NTORQ125;15 Aug 2019;Surya Suriya;4.2; Daily Commute ;All are good except the front headlight power, would be helpful if rare shock can be adjusted/Lifted. As parts vibrate/Broken when moved in speed @ eg :1. My petrol tank cracked at top near fuel meter measure & petrol was leaking after i fill full tank.2. air pump at left rear type gets loose every time after i get serviced, due to my heavy riding.3. The pipe gets into forks in the back tyre.would be helpful if we have a direct seat open button near the key/front(Can"t turn back everytime to open. Sometimes back/sides gets caught after having a meal while opening sitting in the seat.
TVS;NTORQ125;29 Dec 2019;Angshumaan M..;3.8; Daily Commute ;The overall performance is wonderful. Definitely one of the best performing scooters out there. The ride is also balanced and is neither to stiff or soft. The only issue I had was with the mileage. It seems like the scooter gives very little mileage. Despite the company claiming 38Km/L mine only seems to give about 25Km/L. The fuel indicator also doesn't seem to work properly as when it indicates that the fuel is on reserve and I fill up 2 Litres, the indicator immediately shows the tank to be full. Other than these issues, this scooter gives no other problems whatsoever
TVS;NTORQ125;3 Apr 2019;Ajit Rai;4.2; Daily Commute ;N Torq is really one of the best scooter in 125cc segment. I have done 2500 KM and I feel its a worth buy for your everyday use to office. I use it pillion everyday for about 45-50 Km and it never disappoints you. Power is just what you need in city or highway. Sound is best compare to any scooter. Comfortable to sit and ride for long hours also. The connectivity system is good for android user, H owever, except the call display and few digital indicators nothing much is useful in day t day life. Map/Direction is not effective in real world. However it definitely an added feature.Improvements - Yes, Petrol tank size is too less compare to mileage we get. All in all a full tank gives you 150 Km which is too less as I have to top up my tank every third day. I am getting constant mileage of 35KM/L, hoping it may improve after second service which is due already at 2500KM. Another, draw back is unavailability of Apple Phone"s connectivity. This should be treated immediately as I phone user like me will start avoiding the scooter despite having such good features.
TVS;NTORQ125;17 Dec 2020;Mickey Stark;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;It's true you got far more performance and pickup than other scooters in the market.It got better styling better features better fuel economy and better comfort.There's a rumor out there that it gives less mileage than other scooters, Which remains a rumor.Of course you'll get low mileage than expect but for only few days after 2nd service it gave me better mileage than i was expecting.So if you a re planning for getting the best scooter for everyone in your family then go for it‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è.
TVS;NTORQ125;31 Oct 2020;Shani Shanu;1.4; Daily Commute ;As per the advertisement tvs seemed to be the perfect one i never knew that they sells the defective one too until i got one.Most disappointing thing is there services, Least bothered about the customer satisfaction.And the way of communication they do is worst off all.The parts of engine and everything was having scratches and unfinished or like used one.I as a customer wants the product to b rep laced or pay back of that product.
TVS;NTORQ125;14 Nov 2019;SANTOSH PANDA;4.6; Occasional Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Tvs Ntorq 125 Race Edition is India's 1st Bluetooth connected scooter with 3-valve 125cc engine which produce great performance compare with other scooter. Mind blowing Exclusive mobile app which has to connecting the scooter and rider mind. Navigation assist, Caller id monitor, last park location, service assist are the main features of this Scooter. Completely modern technology used in this Scoo ter for youth generation.
TVS;NTORQ125;28 Aug 2020;Nitin Rao;2.6; Daily Commute ;Fuel Gauge is not working on my scooter which is hardly 7 days old!! TVS service people are aware of this and inspite of this severe and major problem, these are being sold in the market. I wrote a mail to TVS regarding this & am awaiting reply from them... I really don't know when to put fuel or not because even if the fuel tank is full, the gauge will show sometimes empty and sometimes full. It' s really confusing.
TVS;NTORQ125;22 Jan 2020;Kausik Ghosh;5.0; Leisure Rides ;If your focus is more on performance (which is totally unheard of in Indian scootering scene) and less on mileage, if you enjoy riding your scooter at 90+ kmph on the open highway without stressing the engine at all, get TVS Ntorq 125. There's another one in the market with comparable performance (from a rival brand), but as far as space and comfort is concerned, Ntorq is miles ahead of that parti cular brand.
TVS;NTORQ125;5 Oct 2020;Abhishek Kumar;1.8; Occasional Commute ;After purchase of 1 month self start problem start. It seems like sometimes The battery gets disconnected because no battery related things work means neither horn work nor light or signal work. I told the seller , they suggest for service. I told the service person, but they told everything is fine because that time the problem was not appearing. It comes time to time.
TVS;NTORQ125;17 Jan 2020;Raghavendran S;4.2; Daily Commute ;There is a main problem in an free service, i have raised complaint in the time of free service, but no one has analysis and service it. any one have the checklist of free service (Do or doesn't) or checked it serviced or not. Mileage part: in my vehicle 40Km per liters consumed/Rest of other things are very good compared to other scooty.
TVS;NTORQ125;16 Feb 2020;Rishi Dhingra;3.4; Daily Commute ;The Overall Performance is Fantastic! Loved the Ntorq but the only problem is its mileage which is About 22-23 in the city and It rarely goes to the highways the Features are Awesome and I just like Each and Everything of the Ntorq But I would have loved it if the Mileage would have been Better as it costs me rs.100 petrol everyday
TVS;NTORQ125;2 Nov 2019;Ravikumar Bomma;3.4; Daily Commute ;A powerful Scotty with 125 cc engine category, the pick up n speed was excellent. I have tested a speed 97 kmph in slope where the claimed speed is 95 kmph. But mileage was 37 kmpl in city around 40 kmpl on highways. If you drive over speed 80 kmph then it gives same mileage as city. The smart connect was a great feature.
TVS;NTORQ125;28 Sep 2020;Saigopal S;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;If you are looking for high performance scooter that can be used as a family scooter as well as not compromise on the performance, TVS Ntorq is your go to Scooter i have been using it for a month now Great ride without any vibrations even at 100 Kmph. Enough Space for your day to day bags, though not the most spacious.
TVS;NTORQ125;8 Sep 2020;Pratik Ghosh;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;The Overall performance is best and literally best in class. What worries little is it's mileage. Though tbh , my NTORQ is BS6 Model and gives fairly a little more of mileage around 40. In other terms, it's handling, performance, comfort are all nothing to out you down but to put you in the top of satisfaction list.
TVS;NTORQ125;4 Nov 2020;Nelson Sitlhou;3.4; Daily Commute;Everything good, But its been only 2 months everyday i am facing starting problem, Every morning i have to kick upto 20 times or more, But it go off when applying accelerator, Now i am facing the problem even during day time, I went for servicing and complains more than three times buts its not helping
TVS;NTORQ125;10 Oct 2020;PRINCE VEGETA;3.4; Occasional Commute | Leisure Rides;It's a good scooter, possibly the best in Indian market.The performance is brilliant (the mileage sucks tho). It's stylish and very handy to ride in Indian road conditions and traffic. the fuel guage is a show piece, not reliable.overall I'd not buy it if I knew all this tbh.
TVS;NTORQ125;14 Apr 2020;Pemmaiah M;4.6; Daily Commute ;Battery performance was not good, to be exact, in 14 months self start stopped working and i charged the battery during my 4th service and the in a month battery goes down and in my 5th service I had pay 1.3 grand for battery and get it replaced. I travel daily 45 kms.
TVS;NTORQ125;14 Jan 2019;Jayanth 23;4.6; Daily Commute ;NTORQ is a good two wheeler, excellent road presence coupled with descent mileage and excellent handling makes it a good scooter. The only downside i see to this vehicle is the legroom, if the leg room was couple of centimeters more it would have made a perfect 5star.The paint quality is descent, i own a matte red which is quite difficult to maintain. Scratches can we seen easily and this is only down side. This is general downsize to all matte paint schemes not just this vehicle alone.

TVS;NTORQ125;14 Aug 2020;Asif 1839;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;buy this when you can control your urge to twist the throttle to the tip... because then you can't get mileage more then 30-35. that's the truthbut If you don't mess up your run in period i.e first 1000KM's and follow the recommended max speed of under 40kmph and maintain economy speeds after 1k kms then you might be lucky and can get excess of 50KMPL...but apart from this...it's just Perfect , be tter then SR in alot of cases such as comfort , styling ..etc

TVS;NTORQ125;21 Apr 2019;RAhul Roy;4.6; Daily Commute ;Ntorq can be termed as sports scooter in terms of its power and performance in the 125cc section, its a good scooter for long journeys, the exhaust note is quite impressive which is further more attractive than other scooters which makes you different from others. Mileage is between 45-50KMPL its quite high though but its performance and smootness is too good in the streets.
TVS;NTORQ125;31 Jul 2020;D S;5.0; Daily Commute ;Very stylish and performance oriented scooter. TVS Ntorq race edition bs6 is a winner in every aspect so far. Better than most 110 and 125 cc scooters. Mileage is 50kmpl on average on highway and city.

TVS;NTORQ125;13 Aug 2019;Raghavendra ..;4.2; Daily Commute ;One of the best scooter feature wise and performance wise. The fully digital dash board gives many informations. But they have to work on their APP. Sharp design, Exhaust sound attracts everyone. We can keep a full face helmet* in boot space. I got 40Kmpl milage before 1st service. One main suggestion for TVS is, pls use Google Maps, MAPMYINDIA is not at all usefull, because of this the navigation feature is not usable. Overall very nice scooter.

TVS;Radeon;17 Jul 2020;Om Prakash;3.4; Daily Commute ;Brakes are low level specially rear drum brake are not upto the level to avoid the impact if applied on emergency. Infact company should have given front disc brakes to overcome the braking problem. Pickup of the bike is pathetic even after 3-4 services it dosent go well while overtaking it doesn‚Äôt come up well to overtake vehicle in city or highway ride. Moreover the ignition sound as awesome f eels like Royal enfield and so that looks are to similar to it. Fuel efficiency it gives a miliage of around 60. Good for looks but suggest to go with other brands if looking for better performance and control.
TVS;Radeon;22 Jan 2020;Ravinder Kumar;3.4; Daily Commute ;I bought this bike on 1 January 2019it complete 1 year and I can say much about this bikePROS:-1.

Average is not so good for a 110 cc bike it only provide 55 kmpl.2. Gear shifting is not smooth , it is hard and release tak-tak sound whi le shifting the gear.3. It takes so much time to cross 80+ .and after that it feels that engine wil blast some how. as it provide so much sound and engine struggle a lot.

This happend Due to defective product from tvs motor company and dealer bharath TVS jayanagar Bangalore and modern service servicing of the scooter. I don"t know how many people will be suffering by hospitalization and some of the pe ople may die on spot due to this kind of defective and negligence in servicing. Really TVS motor company by delivering defective scooter and dealer bharath TVS jayanagar and modern service are very unprofessional in after sales only servicing part business. Many of the customers have not know true facts because you people are big shot that's the reasons survived in the market by cheating all your customers.

I've tried different positions but not that great so in seating position. Mileage is very bad. I did not get the claimed mileage even though i've maintained the eco meter 93%. In terms of looks and styling its pretty nice. The only reason i chose this scooter was just for the LEDs an d my FAVOURITE dark blue. For the daily commutes, I'm not happy.

It's so attention grabing thing, when ever I bring it on roads people starts following it to watch, many many lod people ask about bike, they say is it that old yedzi company's bike? Abhi bhi isme gear aur kick ek saath hai? Bahut badhiya hai ye to , kitne ki li? , and alot more.... I have lots of stories related to that bike which happens.....when you ride it , it feels like a nimbulled , well designed, a balanced design of colur of bike in many parts , with chrome along with matt black colour, and a very powerful , muscled , compact , powerful , machine. The amount of of power and torque delivers it engine in just 293 cc is really really amazing , more than 27 bhp of power in just 293 cc of engine is still is still so far from aal old and new rivals of this category. Highely satisfied with the bike, highely recommended, before buying any other bike must take a test ride of jawa, you will going to amazed.ü§©
JawaMotorcycles;42;30 Nov 2019;Uppiliappan ..;3.4; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Around 24 years ago i owned old jawa and rode it for thousands of km.It will thrill me each and every time i touch the handle bar & pump it to start the engine.The exhaust thump & interval between the next thump cant say in words.Flick & kick is a wonderful experience.I used to get mileage around 30 kmpl to 35 kmpl.Now to coming new jawa.I went test ride new jawa with imaginations & drove more tha n 210 km i got mileage of 23kmpl.Engine is powerful till 110 km/hr then it straining to climb speed with vibrations & becomes too noisy.The exhaust sound is like hero splendor bike.There are lots welding visually seen around new jawa.They recreated visibly old jawa.Visually good bike.I didn't get moved or ringed & impressed while riding.I never need a bike for visual pleasure.
JawaMotorcycles;42;13 Aug 2020;Aman Yadav;1.0; Daily Commute ;Worst bike, first experience bike ka. Rha. 1600 km normal use me. Engine khul gya oil leakage ,timing chain problem . Sensor. Khrab ho gya. Fuel metre kharab . Metre me fog ,battrey problm. It feels like Purchsed bike just for show piece . Spending more than 2 lakh on this worst bike is useless. They are saying this problem is coming in every bike. I have seen. Almost every bike. Got the same engi ne problem While servicing.1st time and then 2 and time also . Every single bike there got the engine problem . So from my side jawa is useless . . Comapny jab tk ye isaues ni sahi krti apni bikes ko vapas lena chye. Ise. Bekuf bna ri. Jawa ka name pe. Bike bik ri. Bus. . They have to. Pay for it.
JawaMotorcycles;42;15 Aug 2020;Manish Khanna;1.4; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Agree with all users, The motorcycle is useless. The cols has cold start problems. The engine runs for 49 seconds without throttle in idle state when I crank the engine in the morning. The engine dies when i chug the accelerator when clutch is used. In traffic also the bike stalls when clutch is fully pressed. The re is an unbearable engine hiss. The seat is very hard. The dealer is an unscrupulou s person lacking in infrastructure and the mechanic is untrained. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY. BUY RE INSTEAD
JawaMotorcycles;42;14 Jul 2020;Yogesh Dhawde;2.2; Daily Commute ;The bike on first hand looks good looking. Style design is good but in a very low quality product. Mine bike battery got drained and needs to be replaced in 4months post purchase. Then came the seat comfort issue which is too hard for long ride. After that in this first rain it starts rusting from its nuts bolts paint and whole suspensions are rusting in 7 months from purchasing the bike. If you h ave money and just to do show off then purchase this bike.
JawaMotorcycles;42;18 Jan 2021;Guriqbal Singh;4.2; Tours | Leisure Rides ;I owned royal enfield standard (black)since 2003, I maintained it for years and travelled mote than 1 lac kms.Across north india.Now days i am a weekend rider.As i am working, Have kids and family to take care.So needed bike with low maintenance and great power, Style.So i got jawa 42, Great bike.I modified exhaust and handle bar as per my comfort.I drive mostly on hill side.As of now never faced single issue engine wise.
JawaMotorcycles;42;12 Dec 2020;Raj Singh;1.0; Daily Commute ;Poor after sales service from the dealer end and corrosion will start in your rear shockers and petrol fuel tank area along with the other areas.I have already decided to file the consumer court case against the company and dealer regarding their paint quality and the after sales service.Better you go for the trusted brand always and not for the new comer who doesn't established yet in the market.
JawaMotorcycles;42;15 Sep 2020;Nandakishor Ps;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;I love the bike and it performance everything is superrb only problem i have with this bike is its seat is very hard. If you sat on the seat for atleast half an hour you will get pain in your buttock. Its very hard. Another isssue is its ground clearance. Everything else is superrb bikes performance, design, mileage. For design i would give this bike a 4.5 out of 5.
JawaMotorcycles;42;10 Dec 2020;Divyanshu Dubey;1.8; Daily Commute | Tours ;I purchased jawa 42 dual abs and had very bad experience after 6000km.Maintenance cost is very high as compared with royal enfield and there are some additional issues like engine heating and break shoes leather loss very high, Part and accessories is very costly.No normal mechanic have tools to open things etc.You can call for more update.

JawaMotorcycles;42;9 Nov 2020;LaJeeSH LaKS..;3.0; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;Bike is pretty much good for its power and handling.Ground clearance, Fogging on meter, Oil leakage, Clutch problem, Bad wheel alignment and bad after service makes things worse.My usage was very low still i faced all the problems above trying to figure out what to do next.
JawaMotorcycles;42;11 Aug 2020;Munish Kumar;2.6; Daily Commute ;Do not buy this bike, total waste of money.

JawaMotorcycles;42;6 Mar 2020;Pankaj Jain;3.0; Daily Commute;Well with very high curiosity I bought this bike. The biggest turnoff was there is no kick start system in it. Secondly the self start is not so updated. Thirdly paint quality is absolutely poor. Fourth the odometer is just like designer mind. Upside down. The fuel gauge doesn‚Äôt indicate properly.
JawaMotorcycles;42;29 Feb 2020;Y Ghatge;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Having owned this bike for almost 5 months and used it for daily commute, it definitely has turned out to be value for money. Handling is light and long rides are not cumbersome. You can not zip over the speed-breakers due to low ground clearance but that's what the speed-breakers are built for. Good suspension and seating posture. Please have seat cover with additional cushioning fitted for extra comfort. Service centers are very customer centric. Enthusiasts get 4 exhaust options to select from due to DB killer arrangement. In terms of look it is more retro looking than it's counterpart Java (Java). May look smaller in size with RE models however 42's engine will surprise you with it's response and power.Lower seating also gives you advantage in maneuverability.

KTM;125Duke;3 Feb 2020;Ritish Medar..;3.8; Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;KTM launched this bike to make the brand more accessible for the masses, as the Duke 200 was almost 2.10 lakh on road last year. The bike is a huge success in european market. The reason being the L1 lisence restriction, the bikes under L1 category are limited to 11kw (15bhp). So in european countries you have to level up eventually to a big bike. I've been riding this bike for over a year now and this doesn't feel like your typical 125cc bike. It's fast, agile and engine is peppy and the power output is best in class. It's a little underpowered for me and but the bike's handling capabilities is what kept me excited. You can easily commute on this bike, no heat issues faced so far. Rider comfort is good and pillion isn't. And as speaking for its highway capabilities the engine is stress free upto 75kmph at 6200 rpm and you can maintain this crusing speed without any worries, but you downshift regularly while overtaking. It retuned me around 48km/l on highways. Who should buy this bike?, well it's for new riders for whom budget isn't the limitation. For college students who want own a good bike for daily commute and wanna look cool in college and for the KTM enthusiastic who wants the taste of the brand first hand and is on a budget. (I know Duke 125 is costly, but it's most accessible KTM available in India).
KTM;125Duke;28 Nov 2018;Saurabh Lakh..;3.8; Daily Commute ;I searched for true specs of KTM DUKE 125 Indian Model. Here are the specs you didn"t know about the bike:Top Speed: 125.529 KMPHFuel Tank Range: 288 KMSAverage fuel consumption: 32 KMPLFuel Capacity: 11LSeat height:810mmThe 43mm upside-down forks are by WP, as is the adjustable, linked rear shock, the four-piston radial front brakes are produced by Bybre (an Indian division of Brembo) and all the lights ‚Äì from tail to indicators ‚Äì are LEDs. The service intervals are a relatively short 3,106 miles. The gearbox is smooth and there"s not too much vibration.Basically, this was introduced for Europe but in 2016, it has been discontinued in 2016. Now, KTM bring it back Duke200 styled Duke125 to India.
KTM;125Duke;16 Aug 2019;Yuvraj Saiyam;4.6; Daily Commute ;Best for beginners.Easy to handle.Premium parts.But there's a problem with servicing centre.They always fools you and try to take more money from your pocket. Don't even do the complete work in free servicing. Ktm service centre are the worst in my experience. Never gonna buy more cc bikes from ktm they'll destroy your bike and your wallet too. Overall Bikes are good from ktm. But service they are providing sucks!!!
KTM;125Duke;9 Dec 2019;Lalawm Puia;5.0; Tours ;well its good but its too slow comparing to other bike like v3 cause the yamaha v3 is a very good bhp the ktm duke 125 should mske 155 cc too and the recell price will be good
KTM;125Duke;10 Aug 2019;In A;3.4; Tours ;I guess this is a stupid price for such basic features, ya looks are good but the performance is suitable for beginners...I don"t know why they hiked the price...this doesn"t make any sense....u guys better go for Duke 200 or pulsar rs200...Apache rtr 200 4v is the best option
KTM;125Duke;31 Mar 2019;Muhammed Ramees;4.6; Leisure Rides ;its "fun"tastic to ride,really enjoying,as a biginer to duke family, its outstanding.no vibrations at any corner.fun riding,we can only compare it with 150 segment bikes.the sound comparatively less with duke 200.but mileage was good.the only defect i noticed that the height,its adjustable but,not so.

KTM;RC200;5 Dec 2020;Thalia404;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;This bike is a track bike but also really good on our city roads as you know how indian roads are amazing, As well as the traffic around us.This bike helps you escape traffic if you know what you are doing and it is probably a fun bike due to high amount of horsepower, The brakes are also amazing but incase you are prone to back pains i suggest to stay away from this bike, If not this is amazing.

KTM;RC390;27 Jun 2020;Ayush senapati;4.6; Tours | Daily Commute;I have been using RC390 2018 model from last 8 months. During this period, I have done two long rides i.e. 1- Chikmangluru trip from Hyd (2000 km) in 3days2- Bhubaneswar from Hyd (1100 km) in 17hrsI mentioned above trips because it would help in understanding mileage and comfort.Talking about the mileage: in Hyd during city rides I use to get 19 or 20 kmpl.But in long rides:Avg Speed > 110 kmph : 30 - 33 kmplAvg speed 80 - 100 kmph : 33 - 35 kmplAvg speed 70 - 80 kmph : 37 kmpl approxI have not ridden below 70 avg üòÖAnd coming to comfort, the seat is very hard, so I felt like it is burning after 350 Kms. The shocks are stiff so if the road is not buttery smooth it will be too hectic. After my trip to Bhubaneswar, wrist and neck pain lasted around 10days. I felt Wrist pain can be avoided using cushioned gloves And neck/back pain can be avoiding by using saddle bags.Overall the bike demands a fit guy to cover such distance using a RC, I am saying it as my friends were not able to ride this for more than 30minutes even, where as I was able to cover such distance. Coming to performance, I am very happy with its power delivery. I feel continuous acceleration till 160 kmph. 320mm front disc give good bite. And the last one is the tyres. They are damn good. Whether it is a dry or wet road it does not matter too much. Whether it‚Äôs a long stretch or curvy road in hilly areas I was confident throughout my rides due to the tyres and brakes.I see it is a fair deal by KTM. I mean the sharp design, performance etc everything is top notch.Note: this is my personal opinion based on my experience so far. Someone else‚Äôs review might vary.
KTM;RC390;14 Jul 2020;Gladson Coelho;4.2; Occasional Commute;this bike is bang for buck in 300cc with its performance and features a ride by wire and slipper clutch and brakes and abs system it's a win but lot of us Indians love touring and this bike is not meant for it I'm pretty sure most of us bought this bike for its looks and performance as I am one of them but got disappointed at the touring aspect of this bike. but hey the idea was to make a mini sup e rsport so that contoured seat and stiff suspension is best for racing. I suggest you not to buy this bike if your going for touring purpose it ain't worth it man if you still want fully faired go for a sports tourer like the ninja 300 R3 or rr310
KTM;RC390;13 Jun 2020;Charan raj;3.4; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;I'm a Supersport lover and previously owned r15 before owning rc390, This bike is completely in a different league from my 1st bike and it's a straight one sided machine built for the track, don't expect it to comfortable machine for long rides, with 43.5bhp in-between you legs it's the best performing machine in the segment with abs but lacks refinement, but the raw feel of the bike is exciting a nd only buy it if you are looking for out right performance machine.
KTM;RC390;26 Dec 2019;Jo;3.4; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;RC is a completely track oriented faired bike with little use in road..its riding posture ,heat from engine is too much ..so take it on a track or Sunday ride..great power delivery short gear ratio (1st and second) instant pick up..will take you beyond legal limits..wireless throttle .. duel channel abs ..excellant brakes ..forget about pillion and mileage and comfort..for those who like tracks..i f refinement is not in your dictionary go for it..
KTM;RC390;14 Jan 2021;Geedikanti P..;4.6; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;It is good for highway rides and absolutely perfect for cornerings!! those who control these bikes can control whole rides and enjoys a lot !! only disadvantage about my rc390 is that was uncomfortable in city rides and not for bad roads !! about mileage go for speed petrol or use octane fuel for better mileage and better engine long lasting !! you get good mileage in highway rides.
KTM;RC390;23 Sep 2020;Sandeep San;3.8; Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;Its a beast. You will fall in love with the moment you give the first throttle. In 3.25 lakh price range you are getting the performance of a 600CC superbike. Since its performance oriented, it drinks a lot. When it comes to comfort, you need to compromise and adjust to the machine. I am more than happy with my RC390!!!!
KTM;RC390;14 Aug 2020;Ankan Mondal;5.0; Occasional Commute;This bike is awesome ....i don't have s riding experience but ....this is my fovurate bike ....i don't watch the mileage beacuse it is track focused sport bike so ....you can't get the good mileage in 390....but still it gives better mileage than ninja 300 bs6 ...i want to buy this for street racing ....
KTM;RC390;5 Jan 2020;Cool Rider25;3.8; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;RC390 is awesome bike with plenty of performance on tap, and it is definetly a bike for us middle class people or for someone who wants to enter the world of motor biking and discover further and travel far and fast. i have a lot to say but this column won't be enough.
KTM;RC390;28 Jan 2019;Johnny Jade;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;The fully faired middle weight sports bike gets a host of features including a fuel injected engine, new paint scheme, full fairing, orange painted frame, cushioned seat, engine cowl, led tail lamp. I do ride occasionally or maybe daily commute or rarely After u know that you will have to take your time on understanding a bike you should learn on a smaller capacity bike and move on to bigger... Al so just like a coin have 2 sides these bikes have pros and cons that depends on u best of luck ! cheers.
KTM;RC390;29 Dec 2020;DELHI INSTITUTE;2.2; Daily Commute ;Performance 8 out of 10 mileage, 25 in city and 32 on highways. If you are a good rider but the main problem is comfort this bike has zero comfort 0 out 10. I'll give 2 out 10 for comfort and pillion comfort 1 out of 10, engine refinement 3 out of 10
KTM;RC390;2 Dec 2019;Siddharth Kumar;4.6; Tours ;as compare to duke its more comfortable if you have good road ..for pilion also its more convenient as it has more space for pillon to seat just put a top box its perfect machine for tour better thn duke bcoz of aerodynamic and handle is way sharp
KTM;RC390;25 Feb 2019;Bhavani Shankar;3.0; Daily Commute ;Not good for City usage. Back pain in riding 10km itself. Disposed the bike within 8 months of use. Used it upto 3.5k kilometre. It"s a good show off bike and treat for others eyes but it"s the pain the rider will experience with time. Back pain as well as joint of your palm. Shoulder pain is crazy. Not too good for everyday use. Kiddish petrol tank is another flop show. As much as I waited eagerl y to buy it, it was the same when I had to sell it
KTM;RC390;7 Mar 2020;Naveen Krishnan;2.6; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;If you are looking for a performance machine the its a perfect. For daily commute its not a perfect bike and like all other ktm bikes maintenance is on a higher side. the main reason i bought this because of the performance and the looks.
KTM;RC390;26 Mar 2020;Jacked Joker;3.8; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Rc390 demands fitness to ride. Cost is justifiable according to the performance it offers. Our bad roads will be giving aches üò∑üòñüò£. Heating starts as soon as you face slow moving traffic. Throttle it. It becomes Fun.
KTM;RC390;19 Sep 2020;Prathamesh Naik;5.0; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;Understand your vehicle and keep it maintained. You won't regret buying the same. Except the pro and cons, stop cribbing over the bad things in you vehicle, try to accept the odds and life will be a piece of cake.

KTM;RC390;16 Jan 2019;Manas Roy;4.6; Tours ;It"s really a monster in it"s section. However the riding position is too aggressive to ride in city. Very good for highways and it"s feature, it"s power to weight ration is really too good. I am using this little monster for occasional tour and for highway riding in weekend. Sometimes use it for long distance that need to cover in short time. It"s awesome.
KTM;RC390;7 Jan 2021;Mukesh Nayak;2.6; Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;Service is very bad.And i am facing problems with the bike every now and then.Currently i am facing some engine problem and service person aren't professional enough to detect the issue.

Suzuki;Access125;5 Oct 2020;Shashank Maurya;4.2; Daily Commute ;For performance , ride quality and comfort this scooter is superb. In fact it is the best mileage giving scooter in 125 cc segment. I am getting between 46-50 in city drive. Now if we talk about finishing, looks and built quality then the finishing of this scooter is really good. Built quality is not as good as compared to honda activa but better than rest of the scooter in this segment. Now on co ming to the features and styling, it missed some of the main features like engine k**l switch, pass switch and petrol lid open switch ( these should be there in this price range which other scooter in this segment have). Look and design is totally subjective, one may like it very much, others may not. But in my review I like its front profile but rear and side is don't like it at all. I love retro design but the look and design of this scooter is not catchy like vespa in retro design segment. Overall I bought this scooter for overall ride quality and mileage.
Suzuki;Access125;17 Jun 2020;Vianna Pereira;1.4; Daily Commute;I brought Suzuki access 125 BS6 on 1st Feb 2020 and just after nearly 2 weeks we started facing problem with the scooter relating to the starter and kick . Our mechanic told us that the battery of the scooter is total spoiled and replacement of the battery is must . We seeked help of the Suzuki access service centre but they haven't give us a favourable response til date even after visiting them 3 times. I'm surprised how Suzuki is providing their customers with scooters that aren't electronically well checked and also their service isnt upto date . Totally dissatisfied. Would never recommend anybody to go for Suzuki henceforth.
Suzuki;Access125;16 Jan 2020;No Body;4.2; Daily Commute;I have been used this scooter since last 2 years It has good handling and brakings i like the most And the performance is overall good complaring to its rival scooters i hope externel fuel lid had a remote operated , Even it look cool because of Chrome finish which gives scooter a practical design . The one who rides a bike for daily commute. funky looks doesnt matter they can ho for Suzuki Access 125 if you guys need some Funky looks and with more advanced technolgy you can go to its other rival , But personally i Suggest Access is one of the best scooter in its segment
Suzuki;Access125;25 Jun 2020;Evan Roy;4.6; Daily Commute ;I have been riding this scooter for the past two years. During this time I find this vehicle very good in terms of practicality and comfort level (both rider and pillion). Seats are wide and sitting position doesn't stress you out on longer rides. As far as a scooter is concerned this is fairly powerful and I have never had any issues riding at speed of 70-80kmh. Few things could have better such as braking and headlight. Hopefully new BS6 version fixes those.
Suzuki;Access125;16 May 2020;Mohammed Ashraf;5.0; Daily Commute;I bought a Suzuki Access 125 special edition on 2017 Feb .And I'm extremely happy . Because I make a lot of ride . When I check the first time mileage test believe me I got 67 km/ltr with the present of a technician from Suzuki authorized service center.Twice I faced some starting trouble . But if you compare with other scooters in India that's not a big deal.Any way this my experience with Access 125. And I don't have any bad comments that's all.

Suzuki;Gixxer;9 Feb 2020;Raheel Mujtaba;5.0; Daily Commute ;I have been owning this bike since 2015 and has done almost 66000kms on it. Since then I have been using this bike as my city commute and not just that, I even used to take it for some occasional highway rides as well. 1. Comfort This bike is one of the most comfortable in its segment. The riding posture of this bike is straight and handlebar is a bit on farther side but it's not uncomfortable at all. Suspension are very plush they absorbs almost every kind of bump or potholes. The seat doesn't have a great padding but again you can install the foam to seats afterwards. 2. Engine and Technology The bike which I am owning is the carburetted one as it is 2015 make while the current variant have the fuel injection. The bike has SUPER SMOOTH ENGINE which is good for generating 14.8BHP with 14NM power and torque figures respectively. This engine is good in low and mid rpm range while it goes upto 9.5k RPM but it is not that rev happy engine. At higher RPMs the vibrations will generate. 3.Fuel Efficiency The bike is a great mile muncher. It gives the mileage of around 53Kmpl at speeds around 65-70 KM/H while if you cruise at highway at speeds of around 85 KM/H the bike will give the mileage of around 47 KMPL while in city at 80-85 KMPH the bike gives mileage of around 42 KMPL. Since my bike is carburetted one the FI variant will surely give the better mileage than this. 4.Brakes The bike have the disc brakes at both the ends and as per the performance of the bike the brakes are decent. The provide enoungh stooping power with the MRF rubber at both ends. The tires provide the good amount of grip. It is also equipped with single channel ABS for panick braking situations. 5.Lighting The bike lacks on the lighting side. It is okay for the city rides but for highways you will have to install auxiliary lights for once sun goes down. It now comes with LED HEADLIGHT and LED REAR LIGHT. 6.Gearbox The 5 speed gearbox is not that smooth on other bikes but it will surely not cause problems to you. Tips to remember Never ever get 3 people on bike otherwise your rear suspension will be gone and you will then have lower ground clearance and which will result in scrapping of exhaust part of your bike at speed breakers and potholes.Keep a check on engine oil suspension leaks and air filter regularly in around 20 days If your rear tire is wearing more on one side then try it by replacing the brackets for swing arm at the chassis end.
Suzuki;Gixxer;12 May 2020;Ajit Kumar;3.8; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides;Mileage is like every other 150cc bike. If you drive very sensibly, can expect upto 50KMPL. Maintenance is on a higher side if you service in the suzuki service stations. Can get the service done in less than half of the price outside. Comfort is good for rider not for pillion. Ride and handing is by far the best in the segment. It's very agile and initial pick up is very nice. No hints of vibrati on upto 80-85 KMPH, after that a little buzz, that too very less. Power is delivered in a very linear way and It is way better than fz and fzs.overall a very nice motorcycle if you drive alone.
Suzuki;Gixxer;5 Sep 2019;Abhi Kale;4.6; Leisure Rides ;I have purchased naked gixxer 2019 fi model. Since i have used it about 200km in last 3 days i want to say that the machine is fabulous no any issue styling is that when i go to market people looks behind looks are much better than fzv3 compare side by side..... But only pillion seat is not comfortable but it is so much acceptable for looks .... Overall it worth my single penny.. there are no any single vibration on 100 kmph above than i have not gone due to indian roads i will give 4.6/5
Suzuki;Gixxer;2 Jan 2021;Rahul Bisht;4.6; Daily Commute ;Bike is simply superb.Never face any vibration issue.Engine is super refine.Only negative thing with gixxer is its seat.Its way too high for pillion rider and bit stiff you just cant travel very long as a pillion rider hope 2020 version gixxer resolved this issue.Else its superb machine for daily commute.Except free services i have always used full synthetic oil so gear shift is smooth too.
Suzuki;Gixxer;17 Dec 2020;Shaik Maamoon;4.2; Daily Commute ;I purchased my gixxer 155 on 2014 year red colour. Its been 6 years till now. Till now i drove 40,000 kms the problem is only seating comfort and back brake shoe its gets sound even after changing shoe by 750 to 1000 kms. And fuel economy too good mileage gets 40 to 50 kmpl in good driving 12 litres of tank gets 630 kms of full tank rest of bike is good.
Suzuki;Gixxer;20 Jan 2021;YESS ABHIJIT;4.6; Daily Commute ;Battery backup is the main drawback of this bike, Like north east types high humid area there has always problem of morni g starting, After bs norms maximum bike has discontinued the shocker as well as k s features, Hence they should concentrated on best or maximum lb battery, Unless it will detorised its brand s performance
Suzuki;Gixxer;14 Oct 2020;Naba Kumar;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides;i am happy with my SUZUKI GIXXER 155 FI ABS BS4 model its refined & smooth , only gears & clutch is on the Harder side & the seat is little hard pillion seat is very High not easy to seat for long duration else everything is great looks is dam awesome , only done side no engine cowl or belly pan on naked Gixxer 155
Suzuki;Gixxer;23 Nov 2020;Pralhad Desh..;4.6; Daily Commute ;Overall the bike has been very supportive with me in every type of situation whether it may be rain, Traffic, Highway, Short tours etc.Great mileage in city and on highway.Soft suspension great handling, Seat comfort could have been a little bit more but over all very good and punchy motorcycle.
Suzuki;Gixxer;16 Jan 2020;Abhijeet biswas;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Great performance and good mileage. Suspension is stiff and seating is not so comfortable for rider and especially for the pillion. Engine is vibration free and gear shifts are smooth. Seat height is low.Good for shorter riders.Finally it is the best bike in 160 cc segment.
Suzuki;Gixxer;13 Mar 2020;Krishna Belu..;5.0; Daily Commute ;Performance is brilliant...but the problem is in the gear shifting...it's really hard to change the gears as compared to the other 150cc bikes...you have to apply more pressure while changing the gear...that's the only issue that I face with the Suzuki Gixxer
Suzuki;Gixxer;27 Aug 2020;Arnab;4.2; Daily Commute ;Am a short and a hard rider and nothing much to complain about this bike. Great handling, good mileage, good looks, now better with aftermarkets, and definitely reliable. I've done more than 17000kms till now. It's lovely.

I have requested many times pls check out and clear it but I don"t get the valid reason, I spent 3500 rupees on them during increase mileage but they can't.

Suzuki;GixxerSF;8 Oct 2019;Ritesh Kumar;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours;I was previously driving Discover 125. I was in search of a new bike. I was a bit confused between Honda Hornet, Yamaha FZS v3 and Suzuki Gizzer SF. I saw all the 3 bikes in the showroom. Hornet was not so eye catchy. So I rejected Hornet. Then I choose FZS v3, as I have heard Yamaha bikes have very refined engines. I have also test rided Gixxer SF 150. Once I saw a person parking the FZS v3 outsi de and it was looking so u**y after riding for sometime. Then I went straight to Suzuki showroom and booked the Gixxer SF 150. I have choosen Gixxer SF over FZS as it also have some additional features like time, gear shift indicator and also the sexy look. Whereever I goes, all people stares on my bike.Seats space: I am having a small kid of 4 yrs. There is enough room for me, my kid and my wife in the bike. We have travelled 160 kms at a stretch without any problem. Now about the performance and riding controls.Its a fun bike to ride. Performance of this bike is also very gud. We can easily cruise over 80-90 kmph without any stress to the engine. But I have not tried on this speed. Riding control is also very gud. We can easily maneuver in city traffic without any stress on your body.Milage: I got mileage of around 55-56 km before first servicing. I am not an aggressive biker. I takes atmost care of my bike. I kept speed within 60-65 kmph. Now have done my first servicing now. Serviceing cost is also cheap. I got a bill of Rs. 699/- which includes synthetic oil. After servicing I have not rode much. Will check the mileage and update. And now regarding the ABS noise. I have seen some persons complained about the noise in the ABS. But frankly speaking I am not getting any annoying noise from the ABS during hard breaking. I have checked multiple times. May be this was coming in some of the first batches of the bikes. I had purchased the bike on 13th Sept., 2019.
Suzuki;GixxerSF;24 Dec 2019;SHUBHAM UPAD..;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours ;bda packet.chota dhmaka.....pros :-the quality of fairing is good... atleast better than Yamaha R15The sitting position is quite comfortable then other bikes of this segment.Almost ZERO vibration.As an owner of this bike, I got milage of 46kmpl after having 1st service.it's a air cooled bike though I Never felt like bike is generating heat. I did a trip to Shimla too by this bike.. nothing went wr ong... engine was also in excellent condition.AWESOME visibility in night because of LED headlamps which provides good visibility in night far batter then other bikes like pulsar RS or any other bike.CONS :-IT'S a 155 cc bike....but I felt lack of power(the only CON I discovered till now) as compare to R15,but again...this lack of power increases it's efficiency and reduces maintenance cost.conclusion :-people who are looking for a bike that can grab attention of people in crowd with touring capability, better efficiency, low maintenance cost and with pinch of power (not for reckless driving like a squid) can buy this bike.. otherwise you can buy it's elder sister...sf250...if you want only power....I hope this will help.üëç
Suzuki;GixxerSF;23 Jun 2019;No;4.6; Daily Commute ;First i will start with my buying experience.Early i was going for royal enfield classic 350 black(both bikes are of different segment) and booked it by paying 5k to the showroom. And after 2 days suzuki launched the gixxer, I went to the showroom and saw the bike and i fell in love with its looks and style. Its completely different from the previous modle. I asked them for a test ride but at that time they didn"t have the test ride vehicle and said to wait for couple of days. After some days they called me for taking test ride and after taking the test ride i just went to RE showroom and cancelled my RE booking and booked the the gixxer 155. Suzuki showroom guys are very helpful in completing the process.Riding experience/looks/performance :Bike feels very planted and stable on roads. First thing you will notice when you take it outside is that people will stair at you and your bike,its eye catchy and will ask you kitne ki ai bhai. Road presence is just awesome. I feel that Seats are little hard but again you can add cushion to you seat cover to make it comfortable. Seating position is relaxed not too much sporty like r15. Breaks are good. I can"t say much about the performance as i purchased it 5 days back so i will update you guys after the first service. Problems i am facing :1.Downshift is not proper. Every time I have to release clutch and press it again to down shift the gear. If I am in 5th gear and want to come to 2nd gear then press clutch Downshift one gear the release clutch and press it gain and the again Downshift... Like this i come to 2nd gear.. 2. Engine voice is changed after 60km continues ride ( can"t say what happened before 1st service) but yes their is some sound from engine after it heats up. 3. voice from abs motor. Its annoying. ktrrr ktrrr sound... To check it, apply main stand, switch on the ignition, rotate front wheel and apply front brakes hard. You will get to know what kind of sound i am talking about.
Suzuki;GixxerSF;16 Nov 2020;Kunal Saxena;4.6; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;well I have recently purchased this bike on 10th of November, so haven't tested the mileage yet but I have fuelled up this bike for ‚Çπ500 and ridden this bike for 210 km after and the fuel meter show fuel % just 1 point less than the half meter so I guess the mileage is good but will test it in the long run, and I really love this bike while riding it, its stable have a good low to mid end perfor mance is a bit nimble in traffic but it doesn't give that smile on your face while riding Apache 160/200 4v, it more feels like a comuter bike while riding like a linear power delivery system than giving a whole power at the start and maintaining that power till the end of the middle end and Suzuki can work on their gear box as well cause apache has a much much much smoother gear box, but overall this bike is good and you won't be disappointed when riding this bike everyday, it will not bring that smile but it won't make you fell disappointed as well, as this is one of those bike that make most of the head turn
Suzuki;GixxerSF;30 Jun 2020;Abhishek Sinha;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;I‚Äôm using Suzuki Gixxer SF Fi ABS since 27th Sep 2017, about (38000km) and the bike feels so amazing to ride and confident in cornering that it makes you push it more. And yes, of course, the bike is awesome for touring long-distance while continue riding. The last tour which I completed on it is from India to Nepal 4 days tour covering about 1800 km and guess what no back pain no discomfort ‚Äú I ride the bike all alone. (Tour was of 29 Dec 2018 to 01 Jan 2019)Mileage with power great combo. As we are maintaining the speed of 85‚Äì90 km/ hrs and my Gixxer never disappoints me in mileage, power, comfort and style. Whenever we were stopped by Nepal Police they get excited about my Gixxer like it is some superbike for them an awesome experience. The route in Nepal is made on valley so power is required to maintain and my Gixxer never disappoints me.
Suzuki;GixxerSF;1 Feb 2020;J V;3.8; Occasional Commute;Good vehicle, great handling, Good mileage. mileage consistently above 40+km without much over revving and speeds not exceeding 80km/hr. less vibrations when riding but seating and ride comfort is very bad, seat feels extremely wooden but rear suspension can be softened. needs to add additional padding on the seats else literally un-rideable for anything more than 30km in a go. Handlebar slightly short(2018 model, SF FI ABS) which may feel slightly uncomfortable and the riding position is slightly sporty(very slight lean towards the hadlebars). Conclusion: A very slight sporty commuter.
Suzuki;GixxerSF;16 Aug 2020;LRS SANDESH;4.6; Daily Commute;Power has been reduced in bs6. But 1 thing ,it never vibrates even at the top end tho it has less top speed (125). Engine is very smooth, refined and bike is designed in such a way that you can have 2 riding positions. If you sit little front you can feel the handle to be little upright. But if you sit back of the rider seat then you ll feel aggressive. overall nice bike and yeah Moto gp is the he ad turner for sure üòÅ

Suzuki;GixxerSF;10 Jul 2019;Kesavaraj Go..;4.6; Daily Commute ;Look and handling wise bike is perfect,but in long drive after 200 km am hearing some noise in both ABS and rear disc brake and sudden downshifting from 5th gear to 2nd gear its not working properly(means 5 to 4th and 4th to 3rd and 3rd to 2nd gear we need to release the clutch every time and press again to change) i don"t know what will happen after the first service,apart this bike is performing superb.Especially in city traffic bike performing very well, u will love to ride.In city 40+ KM and in highway 53+ KM mileage.i crossed more than 1000 km within a week.

Suzuki;BurgmanStreet;29 Aug 2020;Karthik Teru;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours ;My workplace is 50Kms away from Home and Inused to take public transport for daily commute. After imposing lockdown I had to go for a two wheeler and in my basic enquiries and in comparison with my previous two wheeler, I preferred to go with the Access. How ever, when got to the show room I was spell bound mere looking at Burgman street. The look is too good, and went for a trial ride. Immediatel y fallen in love with it. The comfort levels are excellent. The main highlight is the abundant Leg room, wide seat and beautiful handle bar supported by telescopic suspension. I was not sure about the mileage but went on purchasing it and my god I am satisfied with its mileage. I travel on a highway. Every time I reset and check the trip meter while refilling with petrol. Each time I have noticed that It's touching 60kmpl with out failing once. I've tried to test it on a longer ride and in one day I rode for 300kms and reached destination with in 6hrs without breaking a sweat. I am damn happy that I've made a perfect choice.
Suzuki;BurgmanStreet;24 Oct 2020;Gamevids 4ever;3.4; Occasional Commute ;I purchased suzuki burgman street, Frame no mb8ea11dfl8117064, Engine number af216364077 on 29.06.2020 from etgo corporation llp, Sec 63, Noida for my college going son.However due to corona pandemic he is not using it for college purpose at present and is being used for going to near by place.So far it runs hardly 600 km, And after doing first service on 22.08.2020 two days back it started giving trouble and stopped starting, Instrument panel is malfuctioning, Display wrong data.Today it is not starting.Also mileage is around 35 km.I don't know if you spend around 95, 000/- to purchase a scooter and it stops to start, What is this technology?.You will not believe i have 40 years old bajaj also, Which was given gift by my father at the time of my selection in engineering college, It still start in one kick.
Suzuki;BurgmanStreet;5 Oct 2020;Ragunathan M..;4.2; Daily Commute ;Mileage is as usual as 125cc bikes, gives 50 in city and 60 in highways. Pros:good riding style, comfortable seats, Extended front space, big seats, Good mileage, Disc brakes of CBS, Fully digital . Main thing is you wont get tired of riding Burgman 125Cons:Poor pickup so don't try to overtake lengthy buses, trucks, etc., Initially there will be vibration and noise in front portion of bike until r eaching 20kmph, Not suitable for ladies and short men but practice can make you perfect, Top speed is low 93kmph, At high speed windblow will make you fall because bike weight is too low and composed fully of plastic. Main disadvantage is Very very POOR quality of plastics and no guarantee for them. Only one hit, your new bike will turn to crushed biscuit packet.

Suzuki;BurgmanStreet;22 Nov 2019;Beautiful Jo..;1.0; Daily Commute;Suzuki burgman 125 cc I bought just two weeks earlier and done with 762 kms. I found the bike bends to right side while riding and whole weight or pressure falls in right hand. And also it is observable the handle head it not flitted symmetrically to body, it is fitted towards right. And it's from showroom found found on other bikes too.
Suzuki;BurgmanStreet;28 Jan 2019;Saud Nafees;4.6; Daily Commute ;it"s an awesome machine with a beautiful styling, features, sitting posture, wide seating space, nice cruiser footrest and a beautiful power.but there are some demerits also like*thin rear tyre results to slip off in any type of muddy or wet road in many situations. (THE MAJOR DEMERIT)*switches installed for the side lamps/indicators and headlamp/headlight are kinky to command after some month of ride as i saw in my machine.but at last other than the thinness of the rear tyre the overall machine is awesome to ride and as a rider i enjoys to ride it in my daily life routines.regards,SAUD NAFEES

Suzuki;BurgmanStreet;28 Dec 2019;Unknown Track;3.8; Daily Commute ;handling is very good. issue is with the seat height; rider should be min 5.5 to comfortably ride the bike. Pillion seat height is more than the other scooters in this segment. Climbing would be difficult for the pillion. Also rear suspension will work well only when the riders weight is more than a 80 kg

Suzuki;Gixxer250;17 Oct 2020;Sriram Kasbe;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;The best part about this bike is the price segment, Not too costly and not too cheap. Better in performance than cheaper bikes and a bit lacking from costlier ones. Maintenance is 1000 rupees for 5k km and mileage depends on the rider but the least this bike gives is 30.This means the total cost of maintaining this bike over 5 years is cheaper than what you would spend on your riding gear and acce ssories and coolant price of other bikes. The spares are not readily available but will arrive after ordering. This bike is exported to Japan, Russia, and other eastern countries. Suzuki has to improve the visor and also the dealership and service network badly. Their exit may be caused if they don't get alert.
Suzuki;Gixxer250;3 Dec 2019;Sourabh Chak..;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;I have recently brought this bike performance wise its wonderful the engine is unique in the way it performs in mid range tractibility is amazing and then the pull to the top end. I usually drive not more than 70 to 80 kmpl it stays between 35 to 50 maximum time and the mileage i am getting is 25 to 30 kmpl.Seating comfort is nice too no pain whatsoever loved it the led front ones are very bright üëç styling is good but could have been more fantastic overall it's been a great bike for me.

Suzuki;Gixxer250;27 Jul 2020;Siddarth Saraf;4.2; Daily Commute | Tours;I own this bike for last 1 year. Travel about 75 kms daily. Its a monster machine , value for money, pick-up & styling are 'A' class. A little working on REAR BREAKS is required as they are inconsistent . PS: SUZUKI should appoint a better efficient dealers in kolkata...'CHANDRANI SUZUKI ' , & ' ANIMESH SUZUKI ' both dealers are useless people.
Suzuki;Gixxer250;13 Jul 2020;Saswat Nayak;4.6; Daily Commute ;Riding postore is so good also the led lights provided by company was good. They give a clear vision at night rides. Although the mileage is not good it's comes with 34.5 on NH. But as compare to other bikes in this segment it gives a good mileage. The throttle response in this bike is better than others.

Suzuki;Gixxer250;4 Apr 2020;Samaksh Uppal;4.6; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides;Overall, a great package.

The only issue I have is the quality of the parts and build quality. I had noise compliant at disc breaks at 6000KM it is fixed by the service centre. Later I got another noise complaint while idling at neutral gear at 8000KM. I have changed the clutch bell und er warranty but it didn't fix it. So I again took it to the service centre at this time they are trying to figure out the issue.

Suzuki;Access125BS4;7 Jan 2020;Ramashesha S;5.0; Daily Commute;Access 125 is the best in it's scooter segment with respect of reliability, cost, performance, pickup and mileage. It's giving me 45 k.m./ltr of petrol and yet to go for first service. Light weight, easy to handle, bike like pickup.. all are excellent. Mine is BS 4 edition with disk brake. However, I had incorporated some changes/additions in my Suzuki Access 125 to get more utility from the vehic le. Though the following actions of mine may void the warranty on my vehicle, I'm not bothered about it.1. Changing of headlight bulb:-Got changed my stock hologen bulb - A.C. 35w with 42w LED Bulb (D.C.) - cost Rs.600/- with slight wiring. Now my vehicle headlight gives me almost 5 times more light then stock bulb.2. Installation of Headlight on/off switch:-There is a provision provided to fix a switch in the right hand side (near throttle) of the Suzuki Access 125. I got fixed Honda Activa headlight on-off switch (cost Rs. 60/-) with slight wiring. Now as soon as I start my vehicle, the front parking lights glow (at headlight off position) thus complying with BS 4 standards. And I can switch on & off my vehicle headlight at my wish.3. Replacing stock parking and indicator bulbs with LED Bulbs:-I had replaced these bulbs with LED Bulbs at a cost of Rs.180/- without any wiring work. A flasher (Rs.70/-) has been fixed along with a buzzer (Rs.30/-). However, back side break light remains A.C. stock bulb only.4. Replacing stock city-cum-highway light switch with Pass switch:-A TVS Jupiter Pass switch is replaced (cost Rs. 98/-) against stock city-cum-highway light switch which perfectly fitted. This will work for all 3 functions i.e. city light, highway light and pass light. Slight wiring is done.5. Fixing of Engine off/kill switch:-This needs careful electrical skill for wiring. An "Anupam" brand on-off switch (cost Rs.35/-) has been installed just above the headlight on-off switch. Now without touching my vehicle key, I can switch off the running vehicle with gentle press of my thumb.6. Replacing stock single horn with double horn:-Replaced with Minda double horn (high & low) at Rs.325/- with cut out (Rs.120/-) by slight wiring work.7. Got fixed mobile Charger-cum-holder at Rs.500/- to my left mirror.The total labour paid for electrical work is 1k.I just purchased and yet to know the mileage of the vehicle. But I'm totally satisfied with the top class performance of engine and above additions.
Suzuki;Access125BS4;13 Mar 2020;Wasim Shaikh;4.2; Daily Commute;I purchased in April-2016 and now almost 4 Years & 35,000 KM have been completed of my Suzuki Access 125. I have done all the services in Company Service Station only and Yearly Service Cost is around 2500/- with all spares and oil charges. In this 4 years only major maintenance cost I faced for New rear Tyre and Battery which is quite normal things in vehicles. The only problem is that mileage of my Access is drastically getting down day by day and by today mileage dropped to around 32 KMPL which is economically not good. If service station will not help to improve the mileage then I think for long run this will become useless and I have to purchase a new Vehicle. Also sound of engine is become more aggressive and smoothness is almost finished. Although quality of Body parts & Performance of engine remains excellent and I never faced any break down in this 4 years. If you planning to use this vehicle for 5 years then this is good option for you. For daily use this scooter is more comfortable then its competitors.
Suzuki;Access125BS4;20 Jul 2019;Pranav Rawat;5.0; Daily Commute ;The suzuki access 125 is the most practical scooter in the entire scooter segment with the best mix of performance, comfort and practicality.Like every Indian individual I also bought an Activa , the 125 cc one which within the frst week started showing its true colour .. it started rattling the mileage was low and the performance was just a bit better than 110cc activa ... then I bought the acces s 125 and was really happy with it .. the throttle response was crisp and it takes of the line quicker than many 150cc premium commuters and has also got a decent top speed of about 95kmph and will do 100kmph on the speedometer. Im a keen rider and ride at higher speeds most of the time ane the scooter remains stable even at its top speed and feels stress free while achieving it ... with my kind of riding I manage to extract a mileage of 52 to 55 kmpl whereas if you ride like a normal person it will stretch to about 58 to 60kmpl which is a lot better than the Activa 125 which to date returns a mileage of just 38 to 45 kmpl and doesnt even go over 85kmph . The longer seat and bigger underseat storage is the icing on the cake . I have till date clocked 17000kms on my Access 125 and its still going smooth and strong .üòÉ
Suzuki;Access125BS4;9 Oct 2020;FLC Viper;5.0; Daily Commute ;Access 125 is best in any road from my experience,like I own many other scooter and when I ride access,it's just give comfortable and for a fast rider like me,the handle bar is like holding an R1 steering,and mileage is the best one for me like I ride it everyday and even the petrol metre say it is empty,I still can go around in my city 2/3 times,also I even catch up with speed 150cc bikers and so metimes I winüèÜüí™,also maintenance is cheaper than I think,most of all,when I ride at bad road,it feels like sitting on a comfortable carüòäif you read this I recommend you to buy it and check it out

Thier service is too bad even from Suzuki side. My bike have back wheel problem this guys not tring to slove permanently. I really not recommend this Suzuki bikes because if have any problem they have attend and try to slove our problem but thier service is favour to thier dealers. To co nnect Suzuki customer care we have to wait more than 7mins and thier will take three days of time to know your problem and attend us. Really too bad service and this bikes having manufacturing problems
Suzuki;Access125BS4;20 Oct 2020;Anup Chakrav..;4.6; Daily Commute ;Definitely superior to the more popular activa (which was my previous possession of approx 1.5 lac km). Built quality, Accessories, Engine & performance is far better than all other scooters. Available power is reliable for millennium city riding with a mix of jams & expressways. I am driving this for the last 51 years, And being able to zoom on Noida expressway at greater than 90 kmph with my 100 kg son sitting pillion along with luggage. Would love to see an upgraded version with disk, Charger & GPS.

Suzuki;Access125BS4;26 Sep 2020;Suraj Dey;5.0; Daily Commute;I am really satisfied with my scooty. My 3 rd servicing was done few days back. There is no such maintenance cost . I mainly use my scooty to go to my office which is 6km from my room. I go to my home every week which is around 70 km one side. I have travelled 7000 km in around 10 months with this scooty.

Suzuki;Access125BS4;21 Sep 2018;Adrian Joshua;3.8; Daily Commute ;I‚Äôve bought the special edition matte black version and it is definitely an eye catcherWould have been better with LED lights though. It‚Äôs really not very comfortable and rides may become strenuous after a while of commuting.Performance is alright, doesn‚Äôt have a zoom factor and this is what ultimately made me buy a motorcycle, for me, it doesn‚Äôt really inspire you to go on rides more than 3 kilometers. I find it slow and unassurring beyond 70km/hr. Buy it if you want to save up on petrol and and want convenience to be a determining factor.Don‚Äôt buy it if you‚Äôre looking for the thrill of a ride, it‚Äôs not fast.
Suzuki;Access125BS4;24 May 2020;Sharath Chandra;4.6; Daily Commute ;The best all round scooter available in the market. It has very linear power delivery which means good low end and mid range for city riding and still has a decent top speed compared to other 125cc. Handling is not so good as an ntorq but it is okay. Comfort is exceptional. Perfect family scooter , not so preferable for millenials

Suzuki;Access125BS4;8 Jan 2021;Rewa Malaviya;2.2; Daily Commute;Suzuki access 125 is the worst ever scooter.It has too many maintenance issues main is starting problems which arises frequently.If anyone has urgency then local or nearby mechanics are to be approached where spares are.Not available.Its service centre are also not within the reach so it is very difficult to maintain it.

Suzuki;Access125BS4;15 Jul 2019;Dheeraj Dhanesh;4.2; Daily Commute;access is good for daily usage, especially in traffic jams normal roads but the demerit i found is that on highways when you are going more than 60kmph you will found loose of control may lead to accidents so drive below 60kmph is safe. Another demerit i found is that when you are using the self start too many times it may lead to damage in the sense that it will not working properly within a year , i don't know if that is the problem of battery, any way a nice scooter

Suzuki;Access125BS4;10 Oct 2019;Sundara Vina..;4.2; Daily Commute ;Suzuki access has a good engine and mileage..but 10 inch rear wheel and poor brakes are disadvantages
Suzuki;Access125BS4;28 Aug 2019;Sandeep Kumar;5.0; Daily Commute ;After lot of research, I picked access 125 and that made me prove my decision was correct.Pros - looks stylish ( new version with round mirrors looks much better).Comfort riding - An average ride of 35 to 40 kms per day Longest ride was 525 kms Approx. (From Hyderabad (TS) to Gangapur ( KA). Made me more confident with this scooter as I have not faced much trouble with regular intervals of break.M ileage - As per ARAI it is 64KMPL. But I get a mileage around 45 to 47 ( after 5th service)Storage is huge plus point and best for family use - I checked with activa 125 where underseat storage is not deep. But Access has more depth.Even foot space is very comfort that helps me to keep more luggage without any challenges.Cons- As compared with other scooters there is no much digital features available in this except the digital trip meter with 2 trips & fuel indicator.Connectivity like Bluetooth , clock etc., is NA.If you are looking for these features then u can go for Burgman Street.Pick what you like but Ride safely. Wear helmet while riding.

Vespa;VXL125;10 Aug 2019;Nagendra BA;4.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Pros: Comfort, road grip,suspension, build quality, looks, long rides, CBS braking, After 1st service gives a mileage af 40+ in city and 50kmpl plus on highway( if ridden between 70 to 90 kmph), overtaking is a charm on this. We can enjoy hill station riding even with a pillion on, as it has excellent power for a scooter.Con: only con I noticed is you have to use Choke once in the morning every da y to self start. Final verdict: If safety and comfort are your priorities, if you travel a lot....This is tailor made for you.
Vespa;VXL125;2 Oct 2019;Jaidev Madgu..;4.6; Leisure Rides ;It is fun to ride. Because of the weight and all metal construction, it is stable on the highway. Searing position is comfortable. Looks are iconic, and a tribute to Italian design.

Kawasaki;Z650;27 Apr 2019;Kai Thetechn..;3.8; Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;I have a Z650 and had a Duke390 . The Duke is heaps more fun and way better.The stock Z tires are outright dangerous in the rain and the suspensions are soft and comfortable which are not suitable for cornering. . I have it for about 1 year now and I am looking to trade it in. To be honest, I would rather get the Benelli 600i since that has 4 cylinders and adjustable shocks. The Z forks are not in verted and non adjustable. I would advise getting a used duke690 or if you have the cash go for the 790. I am not from India so I don't know the prices there but around the price of the Z you could check out the Yamaha MT-07 the only reason I didn't get it was because the MT-07 didn't have abs the year I was getting the Z and I feel that ABS is a must for me. The Z feels very cheap in the feel of the dash (no average speed of trip like the duke) it looks good but I prefer the Yamaha. It's brighter and cleaner. The Z dash is often too dim in the sun. By no means I am bashing the Z. It's a good bike. It's dependable and good on fuel but it feels like a sedan instead of a sports car if you want to make a comparison with cars. I had no problems with the z so far except I lowsided the day I picked it up because I was hitting a corner that I hit everyday on the duke the same way with new tires and wasn't used to the springy soft suspensions. Just a side note the Z also has no immoblizer so it can be easily stolen. I had to replace a key after I lost it and the shop I normally go to told me to go to Kawasaki for key programming but it turns out all Thailand assembled Kawasakis don't have immoblizers.

Kawasaki;Versys650;28 Dec 2020;Veeraraghavan N;3.8; Tours ;Its a very good touring machine mostly tarmac friendly.The stock tyres are useless so as the stock headlight.The seat height is the biggest concern also the seat is wide which makes more comfort but flat footing both side impossible for anyone below 5.10.The ride quality and comfort is wonderful and i wish it had traction control which will make is a good allrounder.I can tell you that versys is o ne of the best touring bike currently available in market at this price band.If someone is looking for a good tourer for road use then versys is the best bet and if you are looking for bit of off-road then v-storm 650 looks better.
Kawasaki;Versys650;5 Nov 2019;Udayaditya B..;3.8; Leisure Rides ;Happy with the bike because it takes you places, pushes you to corners, and does a bit of everything that you expect. Brings a smile to my face everytime I ride it. Gives me a feeling of everlasting love for it after every ride.

Tyres s**k and are hard to find the correct size or rain-tread .Stator went in 8 000 km1(Warranty [common issue])Spark-plug went in 9 000km (difficulty starting) (recommended interval is 12 000 km)top speed is a maximum of 98km/h gps verified Usually can only get up to 87km/h (though with passenger too). Redline is 89 00rpm. The brakes are weak but I am fine with that .Self-maintenance is easy. Handlebars hit my knees when turning at parking lot speeds (184cm)Make sure you get the ABS version but better just get a Honda cbr 125r as it gets the same gas mileage yet can go 120km/h.

When I take if for a ride it becomes extension of my body , the sound of the engine just thrills me. It‚Äôs handling is very agile and light and responds for more power immediately in what ever gear you are instantly.The ride on highway is as good as on the street. What I wanted m ore is ABS though am never an speed rider but assurance always comfort you. Had to install mirror extension for good rear view, led DRL to have good light and some heat protector guard for street riding and that‚Äôs it. The spare part ordering is a pain though.When I keyed in the bike after more than three months of lockdown the bike was just waiting to be ridden üòä.
HarleyDavidson;Street750;6 Feb 2019;Victor Morais;5.0; Tours | Daily Commute ;If you are looking for a super bike to go on long stretches, i think this is the one to consider. I have rode really long distances close to 800 kms in 12 hours. This gives you utmost comfort and confidence to ride on indian roads. The power at disposal boosts the confidence to take easy overtaking. In simple words you get a quality superbike for the money you pay and on top of it I feel taking th e pride of owning an world renowned Iconic brand which has a lot of history to it. Many dream of owning one and I owe one of it.
HarleyDavidson;Street750;24 Jan 2021;Amit B;3.4; Leisure Rides;The bike is not made of good quality. I mean the fork, the accelerator cable, the brakes, are of very poor quality. I have been using it for last 3 years the quality is bad. Think before you buy. Didn't expect Harley to produce such poor quality bike
HarleyDavidson;Street750;30 Jun 2020;Ashok SK;4.2; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute ;Performance & Handling is very elegant, since it quite low the road grip is good. Long rides are not very comfortable after a point because of riding position, specially if you are taller than 5 foot 8 inches.

BMW;G310GS;25 Jan 2021;Bryan Castro;4.6; Tours | Leisure Rides | Daily Commute ;The bmw gs 310 is an excellent bike! very confortable for long rides and it can take you to places difficult to reach, Its torque will surprise you! very stylish so it steals sights of people when they see it! you can ride it for over 280 km and depending on your driving style, The full tank may last over 300 km.Very economic and a very suitable bike for adventures and for the city.We know bmw is not a cheap brand of motorcycle so it¬¥s good to analize first if you will give the maintenance it needs.However, The 2020 model of the 310 gs corrected few issues with previous models and for you to go to the mechanic with this bike, It will take a while.The abs is simple great! the feature to disconnect it whenever you want will give you plenty of fun! the only con i see on this bike besides the maintenance cost is that, You would be likely to upgrade it to a 650 gs or to a f750 gs in a very short period of time! in general, This bike gives a lot of fun and security when you ride it.If you are thinking on getting one go and buy it! it will give you a good gs riding experience!.

Benelli;Imperiale400;17 Feb 2020;Shekhar Bhise;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides;I had test ride with heavy weight plum pillion rider. Didn't cross 60km/hr speed. Posting some pros & cons in my view.PROS-- looks are super nice to fall in love with it. Handling is vert comfortable & good. The sitting comfort is excellent. Engine is super smooth. Suspension is too nice. Breaking is also good. Pickup is good. Its heavy but weight isn't felt while riding. Overall built quality & d esign is excellent. CONS--The major issue is engine heat. Heat isn't noticed when bike is in motion. But when its halted we can actually feel the heat on calf & thighs. The gear shift lever is too long for mid size shoe & heal shift lever is absent. There is no place for tool kit storage. the rider footrest is large & comfortable but its much extended outward which keeps brushing & hitting the calf. The pillion seat is independent but there is no option to detach it. The company doesn't provide optional backrest for pillion rider as accessories. Don't know about its fuel economy & service cost & aftersales service.
Benelli;Imperiale400;13 Feb 2020;Suresh Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute ;For me it was love at first sight. I saw the ad on Facebook and fell for it. I was eagerly waiting for the price to be announced and booked the red one the same day. After more than three months' of waiting I got my hands on the bike on 6th of February. The first thing that struck me during the test-ride was the refinement and absolute quality. The engine offers quite powerful performance and urge s you to twist the grip further. Ride quality is excellent. The bike is more suited for long highway rides but it handles quite well in city traffic, except for the slightly large turning radius. The retro looks are simply amazing. I am still in the process of running-in the engine, so I can only say that mileage is in excess of 30 kmpl. The exhaust has a muted roar that is so thrilling both on the highways as well as the city roads. Engine heat is a real problem and I hope it will reduce after the running-in period. 06/03/2020:I got back the bike after the first free service at 1000 kms and the service charge was a mere Rs. 1365. I need to go for a ride and check whether the engine heat has been reduced. I was told by the Service manager that it will come down since the engine oil has been changed from the normal to a synthetic one.
Benelli;Imperiale400;12 Mar 2020;Jaidev Madgu..;4.2; Leisure Rides ;This is a good looking retro cruiser. The ride is smooth and vibration free. It also feels more powerful than the RE Classic 350, despite similar numbers on paper. It has many additional features such as hazard lights, great indicator and fuel indicator. It has a fuel injected engine. It is in its element in long Highway rides. You can ride it at 100 miles am hour ago day long, without breaking a sweat. Once Benelli puts more service centers in place, this one would be hard to beat. However, the very reason it is such a pleasure to ride on the highway, becomes a bit problematic in the city. Is heavy weight of 205 kgs makes it difficult to get in and out of cramped parking spots. It is definitely a head Turner. When I am stopped at a light, people always ask questions- what is it?

Benelli;TNT25;17 Sep 2019;Shyam Sundar;2.6; Daily Commute | Tours | Leisure Rides ;Its not reliable vehicle I am wondering how this Failure model which failed to run daily that came out of Benelli manufacturing factory, and I am amazed with the work of R&D department of Benelli such that I am having a LEMON vehicle failing to work for every day commute. For me if this one is a failure in this brand the every thing from that brand is also a failure. I wasted money on buying this instead of putting my money into trash (no offence), people in service are nice and well trained. One good thing is when ever my vehicle become lemon they took care under Warranty coverage but the high inconvenience is every time vehicle becomes lemon I struck in a middle of traffic and push my vehicle to home or service center, that was pain in the ________ (fill in the blank) that was painful. There is no advantage of having this vehicle transporting you, I have a constant fear of when this vehicle become lemon. Totally this bike is delivered me with huge defect with poor R&D work. I am having this bike for two years but not in useful way. I like to upgrade to Benelli TRK 502X but still have a doubt what if this one is also like the present one I am having now, hope nothing go wrong in future.

Worst in electric bike . 1 year warranty for battery is not enough .. battery will lost power in 10 months and you will just get 5-10km/charge mileage. Also adapters are not included in warranty. You need 2/year. Adapter cost around 1.5k to 3k. Lithium ion battery replacement cost around 40k atleast per year. If my calculations are right and you are aware about yo ur petrol cost per year and maintenance cost for petrol bike.

AtherEnergy;450X;27 Dec 2020;Ram Mohanreddy;1.0; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;Buying Experience:Buying experience is pathetic, i have pre-booked vehicle by seeing an ad with false information. Waited 11 months to receive vehicle. No proper information given at purchase time also. No proper invoice it self. Govt discount will go to company account.Just a very normal electric scooter given for an amount of 1.89 lacs moneyAll the other features need subscription and subscripti on amount changed multiple times before even startRiding Experience: One good thing is pickup, but shock absobers are pathetic. Need flat road to have peaceful riding.Public Charging points not available properly, and those availbele does not work, and it need solid 6 hours to get chargedCompany claims 15km for 10 mins charging but it never works with fast charging also (tested from ather Experience center it self)Ather mobile app is just a waste it wont show basic information also with out subscription.Maps and dashboard get stuck in the middle and make you get confused with no information on how many km left on driveKeeping idle will reduce charging, 15% went to zero in 2 days.No portable charger, we need to pay 10K more to get portable charger even after buying scooter with premium amount of 1.89 lacsOver all no satisfaction from 1.89 lacs scooter, it will be just a show piece after few months
AtherEnergy;450X;10 Dec 2020;Sunil Sagar;1.4; Daily Commute;Ather want you purchase an electric scooter for 1 lakh plus and pay 2000 per month as subscription to use it.I don't know where they got this ridiculous idea.I was in the lookout for an electric scooter and thanks for their subscription plan i have one less option to consider.

Ampere;Reo;8 Oct 2019;Riffat Jan;1.4; Daily Commute;Pathetic experience. The local supplier (Shreekrishna Enterprises, Bandup Mumbai) promised sky when I bought it. Within 3 months it started giving trouble with some sort of battery leakage, it was a nightmare to get the supplier to check the issue as they are super slow and don't care once you buy the product. They took battery set for check and replaced defective one with some old battery, while promising to replace that with new battery within 10 days as battery was still under warranty, it has been more than two months, they never replaced the battery. Within three months of use the mileage came drastically down to 25 KM per full charging. I reported the issue to AMPERE company also, they didn't bother to address the issue, despite the fact that both the battery and bike is still under warranty. It has become a useless bike of no use to me within 6 months of its purchase.
Ampere;Reo;4 Sep 2020;Shamindra Sen;4.6; Daily Commute ;I m using for last two months, and hv good experiences in daily commute. But I expected more speed/ pickup in this vehicle Reo Li.

As far as after sale service is concerned, don't know nearest service centre.

HeroElectric;OptimaLA;14 May 2020;Priyvrat Sanyal;4.6; Occasional Commute;I was in two minds when i wanted to buy a scooter for occasional commute other than my car. I was looking for something which was easy to ride so that everyone in the family can uses it, economical and trendy. After a lot of research online vs offline, i decided to go for Hero Electric Optima LA, and i can say i never regret the decision. Till the time I didn't took the test ride, i was very appre hensive about electric scooter. But after the test ride, i was fully convinced and immediately started the purchase process. Electric scooters are future of mobility solution in urban and rural India.Low running cost, you can charge it simply at home, ease of maintenance, anyone in the family can ride and above all you are doing your bit for the environment as well.

HeroElectric;OptimaHS500ER;27 Dec 2020;Kumar Kush;3.0; Daily Commute ;*pros* : 1) removable battery - scooter can be charged inside home. 2)anti - theft feature - alarm is loud.We can1immobilise the scooter completely and can't be even dragged by hand. 3)shock absorbers and bigger tyres(compared to activa 3g that i have) give a very comfortable ride 4)was able to climb a tough slope with my son weighing 23 kgs without efforts - 5)though at around 22 kmph was able t o pull 3 persons, Weighing around 150kg, On descent slope at around 15 kmph. 6) being very light, It is easy to manoeuver through streets and heavy traffic and no multiple efforts in winters to start. *cons*: company's claim of 82 km range is possible only if you drive it at speeds below 20kmph. That too if a good portion of the drive is on downward slopes without pulling throttle.On plain roads,You most probably are not going to get 82 kms even at speed of 20 kmph. - the company says that the scooter runs for approximately 10 kms when battery reaches 47 volts, But in actual, It we stray you in less than 2 kms. - your wrists are going to get ache trying to maintain a certain level of speed or pulling throttle to maximum.- seat is not at all1comfortable for continuous drive of over 1 hour.Your are bound to get your a*s wanting some rest. - no foot pedal for ladies - speed is significantly slow1on climbs - more so with 2 or 3 persons- with 2 or 3 persons, Range is going to get reduced until1approximately 30 kmph. - no buzzer for indicator.Got it fitted separately. - no smart features / phone connectivity - fiber body - outer parts are going to break on small impacts. - horn button is not well placed.Thumb can't easily to button - could climb a decent slope with rajni roughly at 20kmph - headlamps -there is very little difference between the two headlamps.Headlamps are not that powerful, Even at full brightness setting. - the dashboard / odometer is pathetic.It does not show total distance travelled all the time, But only at startup.It does not show battery percentage directly, Rather in terms of volts.Earlier lower1end models have these features.The distance travelled shown on odometer is approximately 83% of what is actually travelled.Another buyer reported that it is approximately 63%.Same is the issue with speedometer. -could reach maximum speed of 40 on downward slope. - after-sale service - the dealer has not been able to arrange a damaged body part from company in over one month despite several visits. - you are definitely going to feel crippled on fast moving roads. Verdict despite more cons than pros, It feels good to have one.But it will be a little too early to buy one.I recommend waiting for 6 odd months for better models from hero or other companies.
HeroElectric;OptimaHS500ER;9 Dec 2020;Ravi Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute;1. speed is up to 45 kmph which practically a lowed side.2. Braking is not up to the mark. it doesn't stop were we needed to stop, it takes a little more distance than the needed place.3. mileage mark is good. if you drive in 30 kmph it will give up to 120 km mileage. if you drive below 40 kmph speed you will get nearly 100 to 110 km as mileage (range). speed 40 to 45 kmph will give the range of 8 0 to 100 km with related to throttle speed.
HeroElectric;OptimaHS500ER;28 Sep 2020;Samson Kevin;4.2; Daily Commute | Leisure Rides ;Good electric scooter for single rider. Each battery gives a mileage of 50 km on average for single rider. If double ride mileage is 35 - 40 km. Best scooter suitable for single rider and good for city roads. Charging time is 4 - 5 hrs. Top Speed is 48kmph on full charge. And after draining half battery it reduces to 35kmph.

And more over you have to bare other charges if problem won't find by company. Heroelectric Armoor, JN motors. Seriously..... Hero ? When I called customer service, they gave me RM number, unfortunately they revealed secrets that they don't manufacturer any product like batteries and spares and body parts and body. They only buy every peace from CHINA ... So they don't have eny technology to test and improve the batteries.

Aprilia;SR150Race;1 Mar 2020;Prabhash Cha..;4.2; Daily Commute ;Extremely good on performance & comfort. Styling is youthful & aerodynamic.Mileage could be improved.The vehicle is very peppy, good to drive and is a great fun for long distance rides.Initial starting is very good.This is a must have scooter for all those who wish to rule the road esp.below 35 years of age and desire to own & drive a scooter.Maintenance cost is quite manageable in aut horised service centre. A fantastic well engineered product from the Vespa stable.

Aprilia;SR150;6 May 2019;Mukesh Sabde;2.6; Daily Commute ;1. Sinhgad Road showroom Pune was trying to sell me the scratched product. They had good planning of this by showing me the bike in the evening low light. Rejected the product and asked for another one.2. Pathetic suspension. This bike gave me life time Back pain. I"m taking the physiotherapy currently. Worst bike for them whose work is in sitting position for more than 6-7hr.3. Look is good. Very good pickup. Average is little low but thats fine as it is 150cc. 4* for only looks n performance. 4. Worst experience in the showroom every time. I stopped servicing from the showroom even few free servicing were left and started servicing with local mechanics.5. Pros: style, look, pickup, compact. Cons: Suspensions(pathetic), Average (32)-that"s not bad for me. Service charges becomes little high bcz of complicated internal design like wirings n settings, it takes much time of mechanic which force them to charge more money which results in higher servicing charges.
Aprilia;SR150;24 Feb 2019;Nadkar Mohsin;2.6; Occasional Commute ;I have Aprillia sr 1502018 over all bike is good for performance but it not for person who is looking for comfort because the suspension is stiff and u can feel every bump on road. The top speed is 120kmph when u are single and with pillion it will reach around 110kmph without stress.The engine is smooth and refined there is not vibrations but the big cons of the bike is that the bike is made of f ull plastic if the bike fell down it get damage easily my bike got damaged twice and it cost me 15000 one time and 16000 on second time so before buying u should think the maintenance cost is very high the servicing of the bike will cost u almost 900rs in every servicing. but if u look performance oriented machine with gearless fun then nothing is like aprillia sr 150 go for it.

In Performance most of the 125cc scooters and bike competing with this scooter. Waste of money and maintenance costs are extremely high I can easily maintain a 400cc vehicle rather this üôè
Aprilia;SR150;12 Nov 2019;Rahul Kumar;3.8; Daily Commute;This Scooter have Nothing Mileage so if you are Buying for Mileage (About 35-45) then Don't buy it because it gives Only Mileage of Approx of 19 to 25 only but Speed is very as Compared to other Scooter or Scooty . Highest Speed is About 102 Km/hr. as I Tested On Highway. if You are Daily usage of Scooter then you Should buy this.
Aprilia;SR150;5 Jul 2020;ROBO GAMER;4.6; Daily Commute ;This is the best scooter for young crowd because it has good power good looks low maintenance cost top speed is 125 kmph for sr150. Its better than ntorq because the seating position and overall scooter is very sporty. Only mileage of the scooter is lesser compared to the other scooters in market. It gives me approx 33-35 kmpl.
Aprilia;SR150;14 Oct 2018;Jovin Antonio;4.2; Daily Commute ;Powerful and peppy scooter good for daily city commutes and long weekend rides . Easy to handle . Has smooth brakes good stopping power suspension is on the harder side and every tiny pothole and bump will b felt on the Road . Gives good milage around 40-50kmph but drops to around 35kmph as the speed increases . The pillion seat is smaller and will be uncomfortable for someone who"s on the chubbie r side . There are slight vibration felt on the handle bars . The illumination is not that great. Tyres (vee rubber) have decent grip on dry roads but are slippery in wet conditions .
Aprilia;SR150;27 Jun 2020;Thangboi Kho..;3.8; Daily Commute ;SR 150 is one of the best Scooter bike's among its rivals, it's performance is great, and is also comfortable to ride, but it's mileage is low as it gives good performance.. The scooter bike consumes more fuel as it gives a higher performance with good pick ups and as it is faster than any of its rivals..
Aprilia;SR150;12 Feb 2020;Shubham Takode;2.2; Daily Commute | Tours;Worst bike. It feel good riding only for 2-3 months then it starts giving you pain. Suspesion is worst.

Aprilia;SR150;16 Feb 2019;Krishna Rang..;3.8; Leisure Rides | Occasional Commute;I love this scooter. It"s build quality feels robust. Gives confidence to zip around the city and ride higher than we do with the regular scooters. It"s good strong braking and is terrifically quick. Definitely a fun scooter. Remember to ride responsibly based on the kind of road and traffic to save injury to yourself and others, be conscious of roads because the suspension is stiff.
Aprilia;SR150;1 Feb 2019;Rohan Nk;3.4; Daily Commute ;It"s a peppy scooter with power that matches most entry level sports bikes. But not much on the high end. It does well in the initial. It has very sporty design with moderately comfortable riding posture. What it lacks is its comfort. It"s suspension feels like it"s made of granite. The service centre is also terrible. Overall it"s a sport scooter for the young sporty riders
