Ford;Freestyle;6 Dec 2020;Nirmit Trivedi;4.7; Occasional Commute ;I bought this car in sept 2020 and this has been the best decision i've ever made.The car is so comfortable to drive and is a beast when it comes to power.I've completed 4k kms till date and man i tend to love the car more and more as i clock more kilometers.Haven't faced any issues with the car and every time i drive, I feel proud of buying this vehicle.I've driven swift/i20/baleno and trust me, Freestyle is better than all three.Fine tuned engine, Comfortable seat, Proper handling everything is so good about it.Best can under 10 lakhs.
Ford;Freestyle;15 Aug 2020;Tharun T;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;best value for money. I testdrived baleno, i20, altroz and freestyle and finally bought freestyle. Hill launch, ESP, Traction control and good ground clearance with best handling and power and least maintenance cost annually(maruti twice in year. ford's 10 year annual maintenance bill is already provided by ford. you jst pay that amount. no more extra cost) and 6 air bags too. what more you can ge t in this price range?. you can fit philips xtreme vision for headlight. it is plug and play. freestyle is a definite buy.
Ford;Freestyle;1 Sep 2020;Gaurav Sharma;4.3; Daily Commute ;The driving experience of this car is awesome. I use to drive a Hyundai car. But its steering feels masculine. The power to mileage ratio is also very balanced. Obviously you won't get a mileage like Maruti but after all you are driving a Ford. It's much much safer than driving a Maruti. Being a CUV (they call it) it's not ultra comfortable but moderate comfort is there in longer drivings. But pow erful engine subsides all the complaints.You should go for it
Ford;Freestyle;12 Dec 2020;Amjadkhan Pa..;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Very nice...good mielage....good for drivers and passengers.

Ford;Freestyle;6 Oct 2020;Vishu Sharma;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It's amazing car(diesel and petrol both) I have taken test drive of I20, Maruti Suzuki swift, grand10, even brezza too but ford freestyle was very fun to drive due to its powerful engine , amazing pickup and power delivery. Good for hill station too, this is best car in the segment. You must go for it.
Ford;Freestyle;29 Jun 2020;Basab Dowerah;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;It's a beast!! Mileage in city is 14kmpl with AC .. highway mileage is above 23 kmpl if driven below 98kmph!! Driving in hills is awesome!! Striking features - ABD, EBS and Traction control acts smooth, Automatic wipers, 6 airbags, Anti Rollover Protection, 1.5 cc 100 bhp ðŸ˜€:-)*\0/*
Ford;Freestyle;19 Sep 2020;Biswajeet Ch..;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;The best in class that i had . I went to ladakh , 6700 kms without a hiccup. Filled petrol, did service and zoommmmm. Ground clearance was the best . Overall mielege and built quality and service cost was amazing. Like in 4 years and every 10k kms it was just less than 4k.
Ford;Freestyle;8 Dec 2018;Abhishek Soni;4.3; Occasional Commute ;I bought base variant for 5.42 lacs on road and it makes perfect sense at that price point. As much as I love this car, I am not a fanboy. Look! At 8 lacs, this car stops making sense! The ride quality is good and driving pleasure is unbelievable for the price point. In fact, if you compare it with i10, i20, tiago, swift, etios, and brio, its the best overall package. If you compare it with the ba se variants of Nexon and ecosport, you"d be a fool to buy freestyle. Buying the base variant is that important!
Ford;Freestyle;23 Jul 2020;Glenn Pinto;5.0; Family Car ;I bought a new Ford FreeStyle, Petrol titanium in March 2019. All available show fuel kml, Manuel gear, music, bluetooth, Abs with ECO, Hill up, off road and Reverse Camera.I have used travel for save fordit was nice ford freestyle.Not any problem all.Regards, Glen Pinto
Ford;Freestyle;5 Jun 2020;Michael Abishek;5.0; Family Car ;The performance is really stunning it has 99ps of power it just overtakes really quick and no lag on offer its mileage is statisfying but though not so good it has a decent mileage and comfort for long rides is good and nice overall its a amazing machine i love it
Ford;Freestyle;6 May 2020;T Sarkar;4.0; Family Car;Ford freestyle is very beautiful and strong car but it's unscheduled maintenance cost is reasonably high ,despite being bumper to bumper insurence. I had to pay huge amount and the maintenance persons are very casual about the cost and delivery date.
Ford;Freestyle;23 Sep 2019;Manu George;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;An amazing car to own! Long drives are very comfortable. Storage spaces do fall short. The absence of bottle holders in the rear is definitely a let down in long drives. The stability and control you feel on the highway at high speeds is exceptional!
Ford;Freestyle;29 Sep 2020;Nima Namgyal;4.3; Daily Commute ;Felt it goes smoothly, no jerking like other cars, n powerful engine, gear is smooth, I have driven ford Figo 1.2 titanium of 2018 petrol that too powerful n sleek, it goes so well on turn point in speed, like hot knife in the butterðŸ˜‹ n safe car
Ford;Freestyle;25 Oct 2020;Kishore Kumar;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Ford freestyle.Fun to drive with low maintenance cost.Good ground clearance.Good ac, Safety features.But lacks modern design n styling when compared to other brands.Average seat comfort, Space, Bland style r the negatives.
Ford;Freestyle;29 Jul 2020;Vaibhav Suroshe;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;headlights are not sufficient for night vision.. need projector headlights and LED tail lamp for refresh design, dashboard design is outdated , instrument cluster need to be changed... rattling noise from doors ..
Ford;Freestyle;15 Dec 2020;Prashant Singh;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I love this car, its totally fun to drive this small monster. If you drive it in proper way it will give you economy of 27kmpl, i am the proof. And acceleration is mind blowing, it just takeoff in few seconds.
Ford;Freestyle;21 Aug 2020;CLASH KING;4.7; Daily Commute ;It is a perfect car for the people who like driving. It gives a good confidence and comfort while driving. But if the ford give little more importantance in saftey measures , I would have gave 5/5 rating.
Ford;Freestyle;17 Mar 2020;Akhil Mishra;4.7; Daily Commute ;Its really good to ride freestyle I driven 20000 kms in just 5 months you may get mileage over 25 kmpl if you ride vehicle at speed of 70 80 on highway I got mileage of 30 on said speed

Ford;Freestyle;14 Oct 2020;Praveen Kumar;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;It is a great car yo own. I am very happy with the performance of the car. Mileage is bit low but can be compromised keeping in view the safety and driving experience.
Ford;Freestyle;30 Aug 2018;Anju Rani;5.0; Daily Commute ;It's an amazing car in driving specially for long driving and it's powerful suspensions and great torque level. Satisfied to buy it . But it should be little bit high in height so it could be much beatable to other segment as Cuv because height of car is little bit from front level according to the Indian roads.
Ford;Freestyle;20 Jan 2019;Ashish Katoch;4.7; Family Car ;If safety is your priority, just go for it with closed eyes. Don"t even think about buying Maruti and Hyundai cars who befooled us with Led/DRLs, thin body sheet alongwith least safety features. Always buy Ford or Volkswagen cars for you n your family.
Ford;Freestyle;7 Dec 2018;Birun Takhel..;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;Freestyle is CUV (Compact Utility Vehicle) not that big, not much small. perfect ground clearance. nice balance. all features in mid economic range. I feel good to have a freestyle in my garage. MIlleage is less since i am driving it in city (14.5Kml)
