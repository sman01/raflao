Tata;Nexon;19 May 2020;Arshad Basit;5.0; Family Car | Tours ;Approaching 2½ years and completed 23k kms and countings I'm in love with the diesel motors the grunt, it pulls easy, put in 3rd and drive within city with zero efforts as if you're driving an automatic minimum gear change. In 3rd it can move the car from standstil and pull from as low as 25kmph that's the level of torque it has. Also own a swift vdi and an aspire titanium dragon series but trust me nexon is my fav daily car love driving around with it all in all am happy with my purchase apart from few niggles being an early bird got it within 3 months of launch which were rightly taken care by the TASS guys. Before buying one i had shortlisted nexon and ecosport after test driving one i never looked back at ecosport. Nexon striked all the checklist and its not that am compromising anywhere it being a Tata. Its a myth many carry around about a Tata product. The only thing I'm dissatisfied is the professionalism shown by the service advisors nothing sort of a deal breaker for the potential buyers if one knows how to deal with them. I know how to get things done for me. But, Tata should concentrate on training their staffs basic professional approach on handling customer. Otherwise a thumbs up. Initially got it for my highway drives after driving a dicor for a decade but seems like it has become a daily car now.
Tata;Nexon;31 Jul 2020;Sans Siv;4.3; Daily Commute ;Buying experience: Booked it on 10th Feb got it on 20th May. 1st white Nexon 2020 in chennai / covid19 are reasons. Dealership experience is ok, could be lot better. Riding experience: Engine is refined, ride it slow forget the word mileage. Keep it above 2000 Rpm, you will see a great difference. Engine likes you hard on its accelerator. Exteriors: all good with word compact SUV, other than the c urvy back, which makes it's a hatchback. Interiors: plush finish looks decent gives German car finish in the interiors, all good with Audio- it's Harman nothing much to say.Pros: solid bulit you will feel l seat height l comfort l Anywhere Driveability l Space l last but not least you will feel you are in a safe placeCons: mileage l Tata software technology. My Breakdown experience on the 10th day: Major software glitch caused vehicle to stall in main of chennai. After using 4 cars for over a decade never had a breakdown but my 1st Tata gave it to me on the 10th day. Reason for the glitch nobody knows even in service or direct technical team. They splashed the software gave it back. There hasn't been a issue since then. So future Nexon buyers think twice. But buy an Indian not just in name, but in heart. It's definitely a better car at the cost.
Tata;Nexon;19 Feb 2020;Sudarshan P;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Other than luxury and sheer performance i wanted everything in a car. Among those good amount of ground clearance, decent angle of approach and departure, safety, space, comfort, fuel economy, price were my main points which I was looking for. My budget was stricktly under 10lakh. So there was only one car that was fulfilling all my criteria and that was Tata Nexon XM, petrol manual. I considered Ford ecosport and Hyundai Venue also. Ecosport i rejected it because of the tiny tyres and overall space. Didn't go for venue because it more looks like a soft roader than a muscular SUV. This is my personal opinion only and looks are highly subjective. Did a lot of comparison between Venue and Nexon as Venue had an upper hand in terms of quality, fit and finish but it could not match the Nexon's build quality and driving dynamics, ride and handling. On top of all these things, I am a very big fan of Mr. Ratan Tata and its an Indian brand. So decided to go for Nexon. 🙂
Tata;Nexon;18 Jul 2020;Mukesh Edava..;2.3; Daily Commute ;The new 2020 model looks very good in its face.Also the car is equipped with most of the feutures as well as safety equipments.However the fit and finish is very bad for the amount we pay.I paid around 12 lakhs on road for the xza plus.But the finishing is very poor for what we pay.In my car the left front door was not aligned properly and even after first service they were not able to fix.Also th e engine vibrates more as it is a three cylinder unit.After 3 months of very minimum use itself the dash board and steering console started rattling which is quite irritating.After 10 months of use the car developed rusting of all four door panels near the handle area for which tata provided just repaint instead of a full replacement.Don't fall for the social media hype.Stay away from tata cars because they have several quality issues.They are safe because most of the time the car is safely kept at service centres.
Tata;Nexon;14 Mar 2020;Abhishek Sharma;4.7; Daily Commute ;DRving experience is so far is good but not excellent Reason for good is you will get three driving mode(Eco, city,sport) depending on requirement you can switch the mode, easy to drive and handling with great comfortOverall perormance is good but not very good. As this is AMT so you will feel the delay in gear change if you suddenly push the acclerator.In bumper to bumper traffic i am getting aro und 8-9 KMPL mileage. you will feel the power in sport mode and very stable even at 160 speed. build quality everyone knows so no comment its great.
Tata;Nexon;30 Apr 2020;Ajit Kardekar;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Performance wise nexon is best in its segment with a engine of 1.5 litre diesel engine with a top class interior and comfortable on long route smooth and very tough body of tata as it's one of the best model tata has made i am not a person who just praise like that but it's a ultimate car muv in this range and i have taken test drive of tuv 300, s-cross which i think is not a car to compare with t his,and venue which is 1.4 l engine and EcoSport but this vehicle is best in its segment power comfort milenge toughness everything is perfect.
Tata;Nexon;23 Sep 2020;Bindu Sushil;4.7; Family Car;I bought the car in the month of August from Hyson motors thrissur and within a month the trunk of the car does not work as in it does not open, seemed to the problem of electrical motor of the trunk. We gave it for servicing in Hyson motors potta,chalakudy and they said within 2 days it will be fixed.Its been a month since they said that and whenever we call them for enquiry of the same they just keep on delaying the service. The 5 star rating of nexon can go down to 4 or 3.5 simply bcoz of poor customer service .
Tata;Nexon;26 Mar 2020;Himanshu Sharma;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I won't expect RR or Beemer kind of things from a 12 lakh vehicle, But what Nexon offers you is the Safety, Comfort, Fun of Driving, Fuel Economy and a lot of satisfaction. Have done 10000+ kms in 4 months, and never ever had any major issue apart from the ones that comes with new vehicles like software update, usb port issues.Highly recommended in the budget around 10 - 13 lakh.Now that Mahindra XUV 300 is also 5 Star rated, you have two worthy options in the price range.
Tata;Nexon;21 Sep 2020;Mohit Sharma;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I m sharing my overall experience with tata nexon xz+ Diesel variant After 1 year of purchase. Overall build quality is good. Mileage is about 17kmpl in city and on highway it is 22kmpl. Performance is amazing. You have to switch to Sports mode in hill area.Gear shifting is not so smooth and suspension is hard. Seating comfort is Excellent.The only thing that disappoint is center cup holder its to tally use useless. Too small for Any size of glass.
Tata;Nexon;28 May 2020;Raja Subrama..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Fantastic vehicle on job. No one can believe that it's an Indian vehicle. Structure, superior specifications, safety and comfort for the driver and passengers. Very big wheels in alloy fitted version. I used to drive majority of my drives on highways. Giving me average mileage of 22.50 for a round trip of 409 kms driven in 150 kmph. Amazing, proud to have this vehicle, kudos to Tata and team to ha ve taken Tata's image to very next levels.
Tata;Nexon;20 Oct 2020;Ankit Jain;1.0; Daily Commute | Tours;Purchased tata Nexon xz+ s from kamal & company in September 2020. The car got a problem W.R.T starting the car on the very first day of purchase. The company's executive took the car back to their workshop stating to check the wiring again and returned the car in a few hours saying that everything is fine now. We getting the same problem again 21 times in less than 15 days. On contacting the exec utive, They are asking to directly talk to tata customer care.
Tata;Nexon;15 Aug 2020;ROBESH JOHN;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;1. Comfort is very good, I am 6.3 and 132kg I fit without any issue2. Suspension is Excellent it performs well on bad roads3. Ground clearance gives you confidence, other cars think whether I should go through here or not but I just drive4. AMT gives you little jerks while driving5. Mileage is less but compact SUV's are not made for mileage, and forget about mileage in sports mode, it will give yo u adrenaline Rush
Tata;Nexon;4 Aug 2020;Hrushikesh Jog;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It is a nice and comfortable car to drive it has got similar power to match the safety it has with 5 star globally its just the best compact suv . Surprisingly there are no fit and finish flaws visible it's very sturdy and robust enough for our daily needs just two problem in the whole car is a missing tailgate opening button on the boot lid and small touchscreen
Tata;Nexon;26 Feb 2020;Samir Khan;4.0; Family Car;so far looks good and decent... not high not low as far as performance is concerned...The performance might also be a subjective matter like the design.. I like to drive 'kheench ke' and this this is clearly missing in this when I test drove it.. it does not have the ecosport's sprint nature but is better than many many others in it's category..
Tata;Nexon;1 Dec 2020;J Prasanna;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;A car with an excellent ground clearance. Beautifly styled interiors but the rear passanger leg room is less compared to the old TATA cars. The exterior looks stylish with neat lines. The mileage on the petrol automatic is sad compared to other cars in the category as per my opinion. The car goes smooth post the 1500 mark.
Tata;Nexon;9 Jan 2021;Arnav Sharma;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Overall great csr in this range, I was looking for its competitors and this was the best option I got... Someone suggested me that we can upgrade features in future with availability of funds but we can't upgrade engine in the future. That was the reason I went for Sub compact suv and this was the best decision for me...
Tata;Nexon;14 Sep 2020;J P;4.0; Daily Commute ;I have nexon xma dieseal for past 45 days and driven 2950 km .ifound all is ok except mileage 8-11 in city and 15- 18 on long drive over all dieseal varint average mixed is 15.5..per lit. It is true reveiw. If any one chalange this then he is ........a person of abnormal mentelity and require treatment.
Tata;Nexon;9 Dec 2020;Mahesh Ch;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Few people say the power of tata nexon in not upto mark.Its just like they don't know hot to use/play with drive modes.Coming to mileage if you are using eco mode you will get 16+ in city and 20 in highway.If you want power than mileage shift to sports mode.U can feel the real power of nexon.
Tata;Nexon;2 Feb 2020;Manish Kumar;5.0; Occasional Commute ;A value for money compact SUV. Completely satisfied with the car. Almost over a year and 27000 Kms. No technical issues so far. It has never given below 17 kmpl in thick traffic of Delhi. Mileage 18 Kmpl =delhi, 22 kmpl on the highways. Excellent services by the service center.
Tata;Nexon;10 Aug 2020;Shashi Nagpal;3.0; Daily Commute ;Automatic Transmission is creating so much discomfort. It gets stuck suddenly on any Red Light and it becomes very difficult to move forward. Proving this problem to service people becomes difficult because most of the times it works fine because this problem is not frequent.
Tata;Nexon;17 Feb 2020;Umarfarooque..;1.7; Daily Commute;Mileage is a major issue in becoming xma series. New car 6 to 7 kmpl is city mileage at eco mode drive and 11 to 11.5 kmpl in highway in eco drive mode. So obviously the regular and maintain everything cost increases. So worst experisnce. Totally cheated by TATA motors. Hi
Tata;Nexon;14 Oct 2020;Vimal Venugopal;4.7; Daily Commute ;' Completely Satisfied' Pros - Solid Build , Light Clutch, Powerful AC, Excellent Music system, Good Mileage, High speed stability,long lasting tyres & Less maintenance cost.Cons - Rear view camera quality is not good ,especially at night, small small quality issues.
