Honda;Mobilio;30 Sep 2020;Riyazulislam..;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I own a 2014 Honda Mobilio I-Vtech. It is a great MPV for family use and is way better than Ertiga in terms of both safety and performance (petrol). I usually get the mileage of 16kmpl while driving and the maintenance cost is also not too much. I think that The Honda mobilio could have been a great success but it couldn't beat the Suzuki ertiga because of the trust of indians on Maruti Suzuki. I think, the money I've spent on buying the car, was worth. It did lack some features, but still is a great car for family use.
Honda;Mobilio;3 Jan 2021;Kannan 1153;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Even being a diesel (which was much lesser than petrol at the time) i found th engine much more silent and easy to operate gears as a petrol vehicle.Maintenance is also not as much, So find this a great purchase.Comfort to seat 7 is goos - esp.Two kids, But not comparable to innova/xuv500.

Honda;Mobilio;1 Feb 2019;Prakash Rao;3.7; Family Car ;You stand a better chances in a Casino rather than buying a Honda Mobilio. This model was discontinued within 2.5 year's of launch. The owners who purchased this car are in a Lurch today, neither holding the car's or keeping the vehicle is a disastrous thing today.
