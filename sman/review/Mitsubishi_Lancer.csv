Mitsubishi;Lancer;15 Feb 2020;CHRONIC GAMERS;4.0; Daily Commute ;it's a good daily user car for rough usage and it also give a decent mileage which is more than enough and about features as it is a 20year old car it doesn't have much features and if we want some we can use aftermarket accessories to add features we desire. After all it's a 20 year old car, it's available in the used cars market from 70k. For 70k boom it's a good deal!! I've driven this for abou t 180k kilometers. Still running smooth.
