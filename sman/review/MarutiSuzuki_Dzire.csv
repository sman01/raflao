MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;3 Oct 2020;Dr KP;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;My Dzire is so good comfort wise and and performance wise it's ride and handling is so composed whether you drive it on highway...or you drive it in city..the comfort level superb..it will give you satisfactory mileage along with performance but there are some quality issues with Maruti like the overall plastic quality...but it's ok..the main thing personally feel that Maruti really have to improv e that it's front suspension..there is a little rough thudd in the front suspension...But overall the is a complete package it's fulfills every need which should be a family car..i Loved my Dzire .. especially performance wise and in handling department..
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;1 Aug 2020;Samuel Cherian;4.7; Family Car ;I am satisfied ,good handling,good comfort overall it looks like a small luxury with this price it's less headlamp,DRL are awesome stylish alloy wheels and overall good performance,and maintenance cost is less that I am happy it some parts like led headlamps cost more than 60000 bugs so please avoid crashing and it's interiors are all awesome,good experience,but last one bad star came service qual ity is very bad , they are not up to the mark but a good vehicle overall I recommend this pretty one THANKS
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;29 Mar 2020;Rajendra Giri;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;excellent family sedan. This car is without ABS but this car never Crossed City boundaries so far and most likely will never. Thus as Good as without ABS. But even in VXi they did not provide rear glass defogger. That is enough essential feature in rainy season. Moreover VXi is a mid rang Sedan car and shauffer driven people at least deserve a reading light above them. My Ford Fusion 1.6 Duratec 2 006 model has two reading light for rear passengers.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;4 Nov 2020;HItesh Mittal;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Car feels good based on the configuration.Perform best on the highways as well as intercity.Safety features are embodied and in tune to the requirement.Body strength: at par and compared to tata, Very poor.Service experience: people remember maruti from the age of 2001 till 2014.It was very upward and visibly less expensive.With the stroke of 2015, Things are unprofessional, Expensive and below av erage experience.Still better than tata.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;2 Dec 2020;Mohit Kumar;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;car is good but most of maruti service centers are bad.i mean there you will get total negligence and workmanship is below average..i got my accidental repais from anand motors lucknow and it was pathetic..utterly disappointed by their services and if i got it repaired outside it would have cost me less and the work would be much better than theirsso think before you buy as their cars are good but services are not
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;4 May 2020;FOR YOUR;3.7; Family Car ;Worst accident repair in Haldwani maruti suzuki agency worst work 0 % of care will be taken of your car there ,expect and do your car maintenance always from outside ,they damaged my car's fender when it was kept in company under accident maintenance they hitted my car's fender over there and didn't replaced it and even they didn't repaired it
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;21 Dec 2020;SreeHari Kar..;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;For hassle free driving and comfortable city driving, The maruti suzuki swift dzire vxi at is certainly among the best.Good mileage, Comfortable driving, Good pull (have gone on trips with 6 people in the car, And there hasn't been any lag that was felt), This car is a good bet.However, The major drawback is the lack of airbags.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;1 Dec 2020;Vipul Goel;3.7; Daily Commute ;superb engine, great torque. Have done 175kmph on Expressway. Suspension is hard. Seats are very comfortable with great thigh support. City mileage with AC is about 15, without AC is 19. Engine is somewhat noisy. Window glass is very thin, leading to outside noise creeping in.
MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;21 Jul 2020;Random Comment;4.3; Daily Commute;I have 2015 Swift Dzeri Vdi. It has been 5 long years owner, till date we never faced any major problems and issues with her. She performs very well. Good Mileage and low maintenance costs are pros of the car. I named her as 'TinTin'.

MarutiSuzuki;Dzire;7 Aug 2020;Shivam Jaiswal;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;looks are awesome comfort is also goodbut quality of it doesnot matches with TATA.I use it for local purpose,so overall it is good for me.But if you travels more on highway then buy a safer car .
