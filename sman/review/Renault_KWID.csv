Renault;KWID;19 Jul 2020;Hydmoto Vlogs;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Overall 4.3/5 The car is compact and suitable for a family for 4 for city rides comfortably. You can zip In and out of traffic happily. Compared to eon and alto or the new maruti espresso this is much more stylish and has mini SUV like stance. Steering is sporty, has adequate comfort. Mileage is excellent at 22-25kmpl. AC is also good. Lighting can be upgraded for highway driving. Not much body ro ll. The 2019 + models get much more engine refinement and cabin noise insulation and the car is pretty much silent. Overtaking suddenly with load may be a little disappointing In the 800Cc model as it is little undepowered which is expected since the displacement is lower at 800Cc.Cons : stiffer suspension, body rattle if not properly maintained. Not suitable for high-speed due to light weight and average breaking.

Renault;KWID;27 Aug 2020;Deltafire Xm..;2.3; Daily Commute ;I have bought kwid climber 1 Ltr engine top end model . The digital instrument Meter gives false reading . Their is manufacturing fault on the instrument cluster . At one point it shows the reserve petrol to give an idea how much km car can travel in given reserve , with in few seconds the instrument blinks as zero petrol
Renault;KWID;18 Jan 2020;Jignesh Pawar;4.0; Family Car;Best in this budget segment. I have installed CNG sequitial kit aftermarket.Since last 3 years using it with 30 to 33 km Highway milage per kg.Have place shockers lifting wich cost only 800 rs.Good and value for money car.Who gave negative reviews r wanna pay for less and expectations are like audi.
Renault;KWID;18 Sep 2020;Pranab Sarkar;5.0; Family Car;Renault Kwid is much much better than Alto for the following reasons...1) Better Stylist 2) Better Millage3) Better Interior space4) Better Boot space5) Better Comfort 6) Better Wheel Size7) Better Ground ClarenceAll others features of Renault Kwid are same as in Alto
Renault;KWID;5 Feb 2020;CsHiren Shah;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Kwid is budget car with good looks however mileage if low in city it give around 10-12 with AC without it comes to 13-14 on highway it gives 17-20 max Body is weak even a small touch will give a dent to car very weak body however it good car in this range
Renault;KWID;22 Jan 2021;Suresh Selvaraj;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Yes. Good choice as a beginner of driving, instead of buying a used car, I bought this 1.0 rxl. Good breaking system, controlled positioning i.e, easy to take on hills ups/ downs. Little careful to load heavy weight, since that's a light weight car.
Renault;KWID;21 Oct 2020;Subrahmanyam..;4.0; Daily Commute ;Good car i am happy but small concerns are there, While over taking long vehicle it's difficult, It's good for small family like 2adults and 2kids, For thin people it's okay, But fatty people you can't travel long distance.I am having topend amt.Usually i drove 110km in highway some times l touched 120km speed no shake.

Don't buy it's a waste of your hard earned money.
Renault;KWID;7 Feb 2020;Mohan Kumar;3.0; Family Car ;Comfort is there in travel. As it is 800 cc, running ghat roads is difficult. Mileage committed by the company 25 km/Ltr, the meter shows as 16.2 or 16.30 km/Ltr.Fuel tank shows wrong reading. In one year of purchase, the door handle damaged.
Renault;KWID;21 Dec 2020;Pranav Jamdade;1.0; Family Car ;Emergency services, Road side services in not timely and good service.This car is not rat proof, My car is all damaged in rates wiring are full damaged.Kwid is good quality car but emergency services is not timely and good service.
