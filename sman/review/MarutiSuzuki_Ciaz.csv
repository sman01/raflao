MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;1 Jan 2021;Praveen Muth..;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Ciaz is not for car enthusiasts.It's a very comfortable car with a lot of legroom and 3 adults can sit comfortably in the rear seat as there isn't a big h**p in the middle.The cabin is very spacious and the beige treatment in the interior gives a good airy feel.The engine is very refined and has good amount of initial torque.But at the final range there isn't enough power output.The engine loves t o rev a lot.I personally feel that msil could have given it a 6th gear.The clutch is super-duper light and shifting is so easy.It is an easy car to drive in the city as well as on highways.The steering is very light that it doesn't give any feel or feedback.The suspension is on the softer side and absorbs most of the bumps and potholes very well.There are few issues with the car, That is, There are panel gaps everywhere.Actually the panel gaps are big and the fit and finish isn't great.The quality levels could have been improved both in the interior as well as exterior.Overall the car suits your parents very well but it doesn't inspire the youngsters because ciaz is much of a comfort oriented car and not a sporty one.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;19 Sep 2020;Gokul Gopakumar;4.3; Family Car ;As this is comfort oriented Sedan, all of its components incl. engine is tuned in such a way. Therefore don't expect any sort of performance. If you floor the throttle the sound of the engine becomes so loud that some wouldn't be liking it. But personally I like its sound when I floor it. Suspension in tuned in such a way that it offers maximum comfort at the cost of handling. Some defects in the vehicle that I found was poor quality of plastics used and the sound from the speakers are below average that you couldn't increase the volume because the rattling all around the cabin is obnoxious
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;18 Jul 2020;Ayush Agrawal;3.3; Family Car ;This car is a cool sedan you will get a feel of seating in a lap of luxury just like any other premium brand. The sole reason I am disappointed is its super soft suspension that gets pressed if we have rear passengers affecting the ground clearance, this vehicle I own is being tested @140kmph and have found it severing while at that top notch that means Suzuki has lacked some aerodynamics too. The worst part which now is being cured in the updated model is its headlight in my model it's ridiculous. By the way I own a ZXI+
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;16 Apr 2019;Venkatasubra..;2.0; Daily Commute ;First of all petrol mileage is nowhere near what was promised!! Despite talk claims of smart hybrid. Looks cosmetic with no real value addition. Infotainment is a disaster on 2 accounts 1) They sold a chip for 10k which is supposed to be a GPS along with car. It is totally useless. We can enter only the addresses stored therein. You can"t enter any address which you need to go. Most of the importa nt streets, locations are not even stored in that. May be only New Delhi NCR is mapped. Why then they are selling cars in Chennai and south? 2) First we were told infotainment radio and music features can be controlled by using mobile as remote by downloading an app. After car was bought we were told there is no app which can connect music radio in the car. The lack of this in a premium car is disappointing. Other premium cars have it. They charge Rs 13 lakhs. But these basic features absent.K
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;18 Aug 2020;Cecil Davis;4.3; Family Car ;Good leg space , boot space , smooth and comfortable while driving . Mileage on highways 18 km/ltr unlike they promised and very poor on cities . You get a pleasant drive if 2-3 people sitting . If 4-5 people sitting or if you have extra load inside boot then car lags much and wont give you a smooth drive especially with those suspensions which act good with less load but when load is heavy then g iving poor performance . I owns a petrol automatic variant .
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;8 Sep 2020;Coach Swamy;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car;Feels like Un-Maruti, i.e. fantastic build quality, tremendous space & very comfortable ride. Ease of driving, even in mad city traffic is a given for any Maruti, but in terms of the owner 'feeling good' inside the car, this is probably the first Maruti to feel so. I've switched from an XUV500 to Ciaz, but haven't regretted it yet. A bit more power & a sixth gear will make Ciaz the King of 'full s ize' sedans.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;24 May 2019;Guru Pramodh;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It's a scintillating machine by maruti Suzuki till date üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è.The design language is just top notch.It turns me very good mileage at this size and price point.they haven't compromised any elements in this car. The music system is decent.comfort level is just super cool.You get a huge leg room.very large boot capacity,premium interiors and what not. They even provide some segment missing featu res in base trim that's.Really appreciable. Beige treatment,wooden finish what not. Very comfortable driving position. It's a clear VFM car for this segment. It's an heart touching car of mine and my family as well. The broad stance and elegant look. Finally- this is CIAZ(lot more to confess but it's seems to be enough for meüòÖüòÇ).The best car of maruti Suzuki üíØ‚ù§Ô∏è‚òÆÔ∏è
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;14 Dec 2020;Dinesh Lalwani;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Performance and mileage are good, Comfort and styling are best.But there are two things i would like to highlight that is 1)the brightness of the headlights is low, Even there are projector lamps but during night driving it gives a lot of problems this is the thing we generally can't check during test drives.2) the pillars of the car are very broad it hampers a lot of vision during road crossing a nd taking turns.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;8 Aug 2019;PRIYANSHU AG..;1.3; Daily Commute ;The Worst material and services used in India in any car that is Maruti.. one day it will become like Nokia.. they never saw the safety features and strongness in car made of complete worst material. Even Maruti also is thief in justifying themselves in mileage. They claim Ciaz Milage of 29.2 KMPL, whereas actual mileage is 18 KMPL on the highway, service part also worst.. I can write more than 10 pages over service portion. average regular service cost is 12,000- 15,000..this car is worst in performance, it is made of poor material, touch on small breaker.. worst suspension and shocker.. and steering will be hard like truck steering.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;15 Nov 2019;Ajay Joshi;4.3; Daily Commute ;Its a smart looking economically priced car. Have decent build quality and average power but for the price its a steal and is not very high on maintenance. Average cost of service from company is 10 G's. Also the car is ultra spacious for 5 people and boot is also very big. Overall its a good car to buy for daily use. Its smart hybrid feature is uber cool.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;13 Oct 2020;Zaid Siddiqui;4.3; Family Car | Tours ;Ciaz is a very comfortable car and offer a ton of features but some are lacking though it is very good car for long highway journeys and is powerful enough with it's 1.3 multijet diesel to make fast overtakes This sedan due to ita dynamic design can a top speed of 200 kmph which is pretty fast as per the price on which it is offered.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;30 Sep 2020;Vichal Singh;4.7; Daily Commute ;Good value for money car, OK milage... robustness is what i admire in particular...have driven 40k now...all kinds of terrains...rough road, no road...seems that it take anything without much fuss... Only thing lacking in Diesel Alpha smart hybrid that i like is...lack of power..when climbing in hill roads...Rest no issues...
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;10 Sep 2020;Shail Aggarwal;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;stylish car by maruti in market in comparison to other competitors product in this type first car of maruti which gained public on price product features and looks .good decent car and if talk about other cars of maruti you see they are buyed b everyone but ciaz is a premium car bought by high end class people
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;8 Mar 2020;Meherzaad Wykes;4.7; Daily Commute ;The best sedan in its price range and lot better than its rivals far best by a mile . Mileage , Length , Looks , Wheelbase , Features at the price , Nexa Blue color is Killer üî• !!!!! i have the Alpha petrol top model variant and it is the best and the most dashing of them all sedans out there.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;4 Oct 2020;Ganesh Thant..;4.7; Family Car ;Over all superb and fantastic for middle class people it's very worth for money but couple of disadvatages are their led projector light adjustment is not their so it's very hard to drive for long trip in night time we can't cross 80 in unknown roads and poor plastic build quality....
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;12 Dec 2018;ABHEYKUMAR B..;5.0; Daily Commute ;I have Purchased this Car in Jan 2017, I have travelled on long tours via this car, really great experience that i have got, this is amazing machine manufactured by Maruti, This is very comfortable in Long Travellings, Considering Engine Power this machine has great Pickup & I have drive this max speed of 185 KM/Hour, mileage wise this car is giving average of 25+ on highways, & 15+ in City. This is the most efficient car in this segment. Style wise & Feature wise this is really great car.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;6 Oct 2020;Lonely Musafir;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Ciaz gives you space to relax your body and joints with some decent external looks. It is light on your pocket and is extremely fuel efficient. But it lags good safety features and has a tremendous power lag with 5 passengers on board.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;24 Nov 2019;Sumanth Bhat;4.3; Daily Commute ;Ciaz, as the name indicates- Is built for comfort, luxury and best selling sedans of India because of its performance and styling. The new Ciaz is worth the cost for its luxury styling, performance, comfort and mesmerizing mileage.Overall, has a decent performance and value for money

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;20 Dec 2020;ASHON VIILs;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Worst steering ever to be very frank. It doesn't even feel like a power steering that's how bad it is. The infotainment system is also bad as it mostly unable to connect to phone and couldn't load the contacts.
MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;23 Nov 2020;Shubham Garg;4.7; Family Car ;Awesome car m tottally satisfied with performance ride quality features boot space is too much and rear leg space feels like you are in home.So much space then verna just go with it and enjoy your super machine.

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;23 Mar 2020;HiranJith Kp;4.3; Daily Commute ;A better option for a family sedan. lots of space is given and better riding comfort. the engine is not much performance oriented but the turbo once kicks the car will flow agressivly..

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;19 Nov 2019;Shyam Gopi;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Buying experience:Being a Nexa exclusive product, the process to purchase the car was extremely smooth. In addition, Nexa showrooms are capable of doing a fair bit of modifications so that is an added bonus.Drivability & Performance:The wheelbase is slightly intimidating but once you're in the driver's seat, it is extremely comfortable to drive through city as well as highway. It's got plenty of t orque so in gear acceleration makes it a pleasant experience as opposed to having to downshift constantly to pull ahead and overtake.Mileage:City mileage of 15kmpl and highway mileage of 18kmpl is quite decent considering a 1.5 liter petrol engine. With a tank capacity of approximately 40 liters, you only need to fill every 500 kms or so.Highway:The one con with this engine is that it lacks top-end performance. While it's quite adequate, the enthusiast may not find it interesting enough.Biggest positive:The suspension! It is just right. Neither too soft, nor too hard. Despite the relatively low ground clearance, it tackles speed bumps and bad roads really really well.Overall:A premium look and ride quality, and a very aggressive, competitive pricing makes this absolute value for money.

MarutiSuzuki;Ciaz;24 Jun 2019;Vishnu Prasad;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;The car is around 5 years old and it‚Äôs a diesel 1.3 motor which has completed 1 lakh 10 thousand kilometres till now and is going strong. Regular service is done without a miss and at 1 lakh 5 thousand kilometres for the first time clutch and tyres are replaced, rest all in stock condition. It returns a fuel efficiency of 14-15 in city with ac in Bangalore and 20-22 on highways with 4 people, fu ll time ac and luggage while cruising at speeds of 90-120.Rattling issues are moderately present, goes off and comes alive on its own, I have not got it repaired. Ride, space and comfort while cruising is appreciated but it‚Äôs not a Driver‚Äôs car. The new ciaz has got many improvements over its predecessor which I own one. Ground clearance could be improved as it has long wheelbase and front bumper height and approach angle should improve to avoid scraping at basements parking areas
