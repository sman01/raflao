BMW;3SeriesGT;10 Jan 2019;Francis Joe;5.0; Daily Commute ;i got this car in July 2018 with a good deal thrown in and the complete service and maintenance package. Good ride, spacious rear leg and head room.. only thing I miss the reclining rear seats and separate rear AC as in the 5.. and of course android auto connectivity (I avoid IOS for certain priniciple issues).. otherwise its a great car

BMW;3SeriesGT;20 Jan 2019;Peace Xtacy;4.7; Family Car ;Very spacious and comfortable. The Xenon lights in my car (2016) are bit dim and lack of navigation package is strange. Drive, braking and fuel consumption are great.
