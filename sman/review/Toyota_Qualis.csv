Toyota;Qualis;14 Nov 2020;Mr. india;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Spacious and airy, comfortable, u will never feel claustrophobic in it and reliable car. It’s has Power steering and dual Ac, leather door interiors and power windows(these features were considered luxury back in 2000s).Low maintenance cost and easy to repair, any experienced mechanic can repair it. With us since years. Still has a good resale demand considering its on road price back in 2000-20 05 and the value getting on it.It’s a box shaped car but Car like to drive:this combination is only seen on Qualis. Has a Body Of jeep but feels like driving a small car. Also It’s was used by police force for more than a decade.Its highway mileage is 14 kmpl and city mileage is 11-12. Still many people have it and once u drive it, u ll know what I am trying to say. :-)
