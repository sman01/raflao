Lexus;ES;10 Dec 2019;Jo;5.0; Family Car | Occasional Commute | Daily Commute ;great car real German car killer from Toyota. styling needs no briefing the wide front grills sunroof good curves on the sides nice and plush interiors with 200 plus BHP from petrol with help from the lithium battery which with the CVT though clunky does the job nicely.decent mileage nearing 20 or more .does it look like a big Camry or small Lexus LS.
