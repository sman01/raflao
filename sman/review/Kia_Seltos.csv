Kia;Seltos;10 Jan 2020;Abani Behera;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;a good car in terms of feature spec. Spacious cabin. Drive quality is good but not the best. Hyundai Creta provides better drive quality. Features like the 360 Degree camera, air purifier, AC vented seats are pretty nicely implemented. Great fan of the 360 camera. Have been using this feature in narrow lanes. Although the petrol engine is not noisy but you can still hear bit of noise (Not like the Hyundai where the cabin noise is almost zero). In slow speed the vehicles is not that smooth but the moment we cross 30 KM, its pretty smooth. Eco mode makes you feel that the car doesn't have much power.Normal is good overall. Sports has a great power punch but noisy. I prefer normal mode in most of the time.UVO app works fine only when the car eSIM (Vodafone) is under good network coverage. DCT transmission temperature is a serious problem (at least for Bangalore). in bumper to bumper traffic it keeps on getting heated and an alert keeps on coming in the cluster to stop the car. Not sure if this problem will be fixed. But with this we can not drive in Bangalore during peek hours. So far i liked my car until the transmission issue appeared. Now it looks I can not drive it regularly in Bangalore traffic.
Kia;Seltos;22 Jan 2020;Zia ul haq butt;4.0; Family Car ;If you are really looking for the rivals of Kia Seltos then there must be your's internal choice to chose what you want and looking for yourself. I rejected xuv300 just because of boot space. Duster was always my first love but novelty and dashboard killed my mindset...Jeep compass certainly impressed me by its dashing look but mileage was the critical point of understanding. Later MG Hector was s omething new & impressive option but over design & writing BIG internet inside long queuing pulls me back then there was final option Kia Seltos which changed my mind after getting into inside and i was trying to find out fault but only one fault 'highly important' could find was the safety feature 2 airbag given in kia seltos htx plus AT 1.5 diesel automatic variant .I'm still thinking on it why it was compromised and not given 6 airbags. Rest everything is OK. I have drove it 5500kms in couple of months, city 14 Kms highway 18 to 19 Kms mileage without any problem.
Kia;Seltos;30 Aug 2020;Niraj Balani;2.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Issue 1 The map is a complete waste. I entered the location of my club and it navigates me to a hospital.The map has no idea about the traffic, as there is no realtime calculation of traffic. Google maps are far better than the inbuilt kia mapsI have communicated with my dealer i.e Shreenath Kia, Thane. The name of my sales person was Varun, He suggested us to use google maps. The map was a huge a ttraction for the customer but in real it is of no use. Issue 2The second issue is always the mileage. Kia commits its 16.7kmpl average, but in reality the average is about 8-9 kmpl for the petrol dct variant. The average is 50% less than claimed by kia.When I raised the complaint about average. I was informed it will give you this average at expressway. Will we drive daily to expressway?Issue 3Kia took some additional insurance amount by mistake and after 2 weeks of continuous follow up, we still haven’t got any reply from kia.
Kia;Seltos;6 Jan 2020;Anish Moideen;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;A good car with great handling and advanced features. Pros - styling, power, steering, a/c, HUD, voice command, navigation, 360 camera, parking assist, sunroof, ventilated seats, but worth the money. Cons - tyre size, rear shock absorbers, boss subwoofer, space inside, luggage space, front bumper ground clearance, UVO IOS app, front seat head rest stitching, driver seat thigh support. Could have e asily improved few of the items to suit Indian conditions.
Kia;Seltos;12 Jun 2020;Asif Karimulla;4.7; Family Car | Tours ;Power is very linear, Kia should either provide turbo retrofit or hybrid retrofit kits to the existing customers at a decent price point as an optional accessory, Seltos has created a history benchmark, now assume Hybrid retrofit kit as an accessory can be displayed in showroom and left to buyers to opt for, does I sound innovative campaign for Kia, I received delivery on 31st August HTX Petrol NA variant and have done 18K kms so far.
Kia;Seltos;9 Jun 2020;Krishna Kanth;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;After a lot of R&D finally got the Kia Seltos HTE Diesel. I must say, I do not regret my decision. It is an absolute delight to drive this baby. The power is more than adequate to skim through Bengaluru city traffic and out on the highway, you just put your feet down, Seltos does the remaining. Overtaking is never a problem even if you are at speeds over 120 KMPH. Overall a value for money package .
Kia;Seltos;17 Nov 2020;Akshat Pokhr..;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;Got myself a GTX+ 1.4 Turbo manual a month back. First free service done today. So far the car has been amazing, be it performance or comfort. Comes packed with features, and it makes you fall in love with all of them.Only disappointing factor is that it scored just 3 stars in global NCAP crash test, which is terrible considering that Tiago scored 4 and Nexon scored 5 stars.
Kia;Seltos;18 Jun 2020;Guru Karkera;5.0; Family Car ;I booked the Kia seltos HTX BLACK COLOR even before it was launched, but I got the delivery only in Feb as the black color was not available as per the dealer. I booked the car for its looks, Interior and features it offered, however I am very satisfied with its drivability and responsiveness. I saw a huge bump in performance after my first service. Great Family SUV.
Kia;Seltos;1 Sep 2020;Keshav Rana;3.0; Daily Commute ;Bought the Seltos Petrol 1.5 last year. The mileage in the city is 10 kmpl. The car has good styling in the front, but looks pretty bland from the rear end. Engine feels refined, but not very powerful as the 1.4 turbo. Also suspension is on the stiffer side. But would suggest new buyers to also have a look at the Hyundai Creta now. Its suspension is better
Kia;Seltos;24 Nov 2020;Sandeep Masih;5.0; Daily Commute ;I'm driving 1.5 petrol ivt.Done 6000km.Absolute pleasure driving in both city n highway conditions.Mileage is around 13.5-14 kmph in city with ac n goes upto 17kmph on highways if you drive in range of 90-110 speed.If you cruise at 90 it'll go upto 20kmph mileage.Super comfortable front n rear seats.Sturdy road grip n fim steering.Love my car.
Kia;Seltos;8 Feb 2020;Ashok T;4.3; Family Car ;I took delivery of Kia seltos htk plus desiel automatic it is really good I drove from Bangalore to chikmagalur the journey was good driving pleasure is nice on the whole the vehicle is good and one more thing to add the Kia people should have put the Kia emblem on the grill it would have been nice.
Kia;Seltos;22 Nov 2019;Dhaval Thoda;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car;SELTOS IS A PERFECT CAR FOR CITIES AND TOURING AS ITS NOT TOO HUGE NEITHER SMALL. ITS A SILENT CAR WITH AN AVERAGE PICK UP. I HAD A HYUNDAI VERNA TRANSFORM WHICH HAD THE BEST PICK UP IN ITS SEGMENT, SO I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. BUT OVERALL EXPERIENCE TILL NOW IS GOOD AS ITS JUST 2 WEEKS OLD.;)
Kia;Seltos;8 Oct 2020;Piraj Mondal;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;The looks is what attracted me the most along with all the features specially the uvo connect feature.Seats are quite comfortable. Very refined and silent engine.There is no lag in power although the turbo variant does a great job in terms of pick up.Overall it's a value for money car.
Kia;Seltos;24 Jul 2020;Parag Mahadik;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Using it for 11 months now. I bought HTK+ petrol model. Car drives great. Nice handling better than my Honda city. Great milage I get 16. Specious fits three people in the rear seat comfortablely. I do miss climate control though. The HTK+ pickup is low, a turbo would have been nice.
Kia;Seltos;28 Sep 2020;Chandra Prakash;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;GTX DCT petrol, just reached 600km and find out to be very handy in handling, driving comfort is next level, 360 camera helps you to reverse the car even in narrow streets, HUD is something special and blind spot is amazing. bit concern about the milage.
Kia;Seltos;7 Dec 2020;Sudev Nair;5.0; Family Car ;Seltos gives a comfortable and stable drive on high speed in the highways.No vibrations on high speeds.Even while applying breaks you have full control of the vehicle.Gives an overall mileage of 17.5 in highways and 15.5 in the city.
Kia;Seltos;31 Oct 2020;DeepakSharma 19;5.0; Daily Commute ;The only car which is so feature loaded added with Power packed performance.Turns heads by the headlights and DRL.The only problem is that I own a 19 lakhs Seltos my neighbour owns a 14 lakhs Seltos both look almost same.
Kia;Seltos;1 Dec 2019;Nishant Nagar;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The 1.5 petrol engine on offer in seltos is a good engine and low on maintenance and powerful enough. Handling is also great in this car . Comfortable for 3 - 4 passengers with luggage for a weekend trip or long vacations.
Kia;Seltos;5 Nov 2020;Play Store;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;It is a good looking car and is spacious also have a big boot. But the 1.5 engne does not give funtodrive factor. It looks more expensive than the price so it is the best showoff vehicle.
