Hyundai;Grandi10;9 Mar 2020;Harish CHALL..;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;a perfect car for a family of 4. worth every single penny. best car in this segment. I frequently travel long distances (700kms) at a stretch, never felt troubled. goes very smooth upto 130-140km. from 140, vehicle starts slightly trembling. but in our roads, we rarely go for that speed continuously. a reasonable mileage of 15-18 Kms(petrol variant). a great look. don't ever ask about the interior s, Hyundai is always the best in this. good controls, great boot space and leg space. this is the only car in this segment which gives a rear AC vent. engine is very smooth. car is very safe. only minor problem is: the bottom portion is made of plastic, if the car goes over some oddly constructed speed breakers or deep pits there are high chances that the bottom carrier assembly getting broken. it happened twice for me in the first year of purchase itself. then I understood that I need to go slower than the slowest over such places and then never faced any problem.apart from that, I have no single complaint. go for minimum sports version, to enjoy a wholesome ride.
Hyundai;Grandi10;28 Oct 2020;Pramit Roy;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I bought this car in December 2018. And I have been using this car for the last 2 years and I'm happy with the car till now. Overall performance is good, I drove the car on tarmac, Hill station, Bad roads filled with potholes and I'm impressed with the ride quality of this car. The only con/disadvantage of this car is its ground clearance (approach angle specifically). The ground clearance is quit e low and not ideal for Indian road conditions. Rest it's a perfect family car with good performance and decent mileage. An initial lag is there but post-2000 rpm performs quite well till 5000 RPM. The comfort that the car provides is best in its segment I feel. Overall I'm happy with the car. It's a comfortable feature-rich family car with good performance and driving dynamics.
Hyundai;Grandi10;2 Sep 2020;Kumar Doka;4.0; Family Car ;Nice car but this may up more, in my entire drive I enjoying a lot n good news is that still I didn't allow to touch the engine part because it's one handed owner. Good car in my opinion. M happy to be a customer for Hyundai but unfortunately to say that now m going to be a KIA's customer for kia sonet or may be for mahindra company for new n exciting most awaited suv in India. But first preferenc e shall be goes on KIA's sonet because lots of tremendously loaded with features but before buying I would like to confirm KIA's sonet ground clearance, if it is more than 190 mm of ground clearance then definitely go for the KIA's sonetü§© because in my state maximum of roads are hilly as well tough roads too.
Hyundai;Grandi10;20 Sep 2019;Jonathan Emmett;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Own 2014 Asta Petrol. Gives me 18kmpl in the city and on long highway drives goes upto 24kmpl. For a family of 3. A good comfortable car with enough space for luggage. Driving is easy in the city with the dimensions. Parking and turning in tight spaces is a breeze. Engine response is good enough and gives you the small boost needed for fast overtakes. Seems confident enough on the highways at fast speeds but I don"t push it more than the 100km mark. Hyundai"s design language is one of my favorites before Honda"s. And the Asta version is feature packed.
Hyundai;Grandi10;27 Sep 2019;Dinesh Mishra;2.0; Daily Commute ;i have owned a grand i10 magna crdi in april 2016 and engine wise it is very bad experience the injectors and turbo chagers are not working properly. i have not ever seen such a bad performance car. I advice to management to take action to resolve this problem. most of your customers like me are suffering it"s effects your compeny image also. please resolve the problem other wise i will never adic e to anyone to purchase your products. i am shamed after purchasing this product and your company naglegence.
Hyundai;Grandi10;14 Oct 2019;Thang Seldou;3.7; Family Car ;First of all, it is a stylish hatchback that beats the hell out of Maruti Swift and others. Interior is tip top, materials used are superior to other cars in this price segment. Smooth and problem free driving, no major maintenance needed in 5 years. Mileage is not the best in its segment, but it is ok. Overall, it surpasses others in style and comfort. But due to the low ground clearance, the fro nt bumper very often scrapes the ground in bad roads. So have to be careful while driving over potholes.
Hyundai;Grandi10;19 Feb 2020;Sooraj S;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;this is my father's car so I also drive it my experience with this car is fantastic driving .we had gone for a long trip still it makes our face even more happy .The performance of the car is mindblowingly phenomenal it's suspension is apt for our Indian roads but it's stearing has no feel and feedback . it's automatic transmission is a 5 speed torque converter & it gives sudden response

Hyundai;Grandi10;21 May 2020;Binoy Lakra;3.3; Daily Commute;Worst pickup and suspension feels like riding a bullock cart with AC or without it doesn't matter.If possible I want to change its suspension and make it like of Ford , Honda etc. Hyundai should make it more sporty so that it would be a driver's car for enjoyable ride. No issue with its fit & finish, interior,music system, pricing etc.I suggest new buyer to go for Ford/Honda.
Hyundai;Grandi10;6 Jul 2020;Suman Roy;5.0; Occasional Commute ;It is a good hatchback which has the basic requirements all in place such as seatbelt alert, all four power windows and good torque. Now that diesel price is almost equal with Petrol, I do not have any qualms on why I did not get a Diesel variety. The after sales experience was not upto the mark but that does not count towards the manufacturer :)
Hyundai;Grandi10;24 Sep 2020;Laxmikant Pa..;4.3; Daily Commute ;it was a very good car and nice mileage as hyundai has offer comfortable ride. but has some problems with the car that is its front fenter is very frazile and bad quality plus its engine cabinet made with plastic so it may be breaking on every hard bump car make.....as a diesel car it has 18Kmpl mileage in city and 22 Kmpl mileage in highway.
Hyundai;Grandi10;17 Mar 2020;Abdias Michael;4.3; Daily Commute ;It's a wonderful hatchback and I would go on to say it's the best in its segment! The features it offers are amazing and the best thing I like about the car is that it is so silent. Hyundai has done really well in keeping engine noise outside the cabin. I feel it's a little underpowered for a 1.2 l engine, rest everything is superb!!
Hyundai;Grandi10;5 Dec 2020;Vikas Kumar;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car;I am using this car for my personal requirements. It met my expectations for the price(6.6lcs for 2017) I have paid. maximum mileage it clicked till now is 18Kmpl. on an average 16 kmpl.this vehicle.afe me feel good and gave good experiences. It was a good but then. Even it can compete and beat many in its current segment vehicles.
Hyundai;Grandi10;21 Jul 2020;Jashwant Sonara;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;nice car, gives for what it was bought. 83bhp of 1.2L engine gives power pick-up, overtaken even BMW and other so called SUVs too by this. small enough to ride in streets of city and parked anywhere. smooth drive, never checked mileage but some say around 15. still same power and strength after use of 4 years 46k kms
Hyundai;Grandi10;13 Jan 2019;Sanjeev Shir..;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It gives me a mileage of 17 in 75% city and 25% semi highway condition and 21.5 kmpl in 90% Highway condition.The Car is very good as far as reliability is concerned. I was owning Santro Xing GLS since 2009 also earlier, the same trust continues in Grand i10 Sports which i bought in 2015 also. You Start the vehicle and go wherever is your destination, it will take you and bring you back without an y breakdown. That is assured. Frequent minor breakdown is also not there in the Vehicle. But No Airbags. As for me Safety First of my Family.Accident Happens only Once and forever.So safety first.
Hyundai;Grandi10;2 Jan 2021;Mukesh Sharma;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Very Good car with best suspension and very calm cabin. Zero noise at idling in cabin. No bodyroll at high speeds. I feel as i am driving at water at high as well as low speed. Strong bumpers as well as body as small hits does not effect bumpers. Very good fit and finish. 12-13 in city and 18-19 at highway mileage.
Hyundai;Grandi10;12 Jul 2020;Ankit Shah;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours ;I drive approx 300-400 kms a week. The performance of the car as been very good considering my usage, which is 80% highways and 20% off roads. Only two issues - fog lights (there is great scope of improvement) & seat. I get an average of 17-17.5 kmpl of complete highway drive & 15-15.5 kmpl for city + highway drive.
Hyundai;Grandi10;20 Feb 2019;Aman Yadav;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I am having the 2016 sportz crdi variant of this. Its overall a nice package. For short highway trips with 4 people in the car. For the daily commute its the best one as it has the LIGHTEST steering wheel among all the cars i"ve driven making it easy for me when i have to reach office in the busy city like noida. Also ive taken this through highways many times, most of the time it was allahabad wh ich is around 700kms from my home its not good to drive over 100 as steering is too light, but its not that problematic. Also it returns a nice milage of 21 kmpl on highways and 17kmpl in city.
Hyundai;Grandi10;13 Aug 2020;Riju Das;4.3; Daily Commute ;Hyundai grand i 10 is a very good car but service centres are lagging behind compared to Maruti. maintenance cost is higher than that of maruti cars of the same price range and mileage is poor. But it was the most stylish car of this hatchbach segment and most comfortable too.
Hyundai;Grandi10;14 Jan 2019;Subhasish Bala;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Done about 11k kms in just more than an year, have taken it to 2500+kms road trip. Fully satisfied with the car. Does come with cooled glovebox which is a boon for road trips which the swift or other maruti and ford misses on. Apt power on Highway for overtaking but a slight less for dominating overtakes. Overall great experience. Miss the lack of centre armrest and an auto dimming electrochromic irvm and the wheels are a tad too small. Also 5th gearing should be kept longer. 100kmph at 2900rpm almost
Hyundai;Grandi10;18 Jan 2019;Hormazd Irani;4.3; Tours ;Since I love the mountains, I wanted a car which could pull comfortably and hence I opted for the diesel version also known as CRDI (common rail diesel injection). I have since been using this car for family outings mostly out of town. This is where you can see that the diesel shines. It feels effortless to drive and returns excellent mileage. I could not have asked for more. It is well built and is a reliable performer. It takes up less space when parking and hence is good for use in city too.

Hyundai;Grandi10;6 Jan 2020;Roopesh B;3.3; Daily Commute;Spares are very expensive and the service points are very bad especially popular motors karamana service center.

Hyundai;Grandi10;7 Sep 2020;My Funny;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;This car is so much feature rich in terms of interior quality it's far superior than other competitors, mileage in city is around 9-12and on highways it's 14-16, I think it's pretty adequate if you get good performance
Hyundai;Grandi10;14 Jun 2020;Mahesh Lal;4.7; Family Car;very comfortable car . driving is easy.good mileage.style.low maintenance cost.very smooth engine.pulling is not the best in top gears while climbing .but in highways it's performance is awesome.totally I love this car.
Hyundai;Grandi10;27 Sep 2019;Praveen P;4.3; Family Car ;Good car for a small family, I own a asta petrol manual, good on comfort and driving easy on expense. A center console whould have added more space for items like wallet mobile etcOverall it is a good hatch back

Hyundai;Grandi10;22 Oct 2019;Rajesh K;3.3; Daily Commute ;the best to have for daily commute in city and occasional highway duties. if you need good driving experience and more saftey but can survive with lesser interior quality you can always go with ford figo
Hyundai;Grandi10;25 Dec 2020;Uday Challa;4.0; Occasional Commute | Tours;Happy with mileage, But ground clearance is too low, 3 adults sitting in rear seat is compromise, Gear shift is hard and many times very lag in second gear felt as 3 cylinder is very weak at this gear.

Hyundai;Grandi10;6 Aug 2020;Manish Saini;3.7; Family Car ;Grand 10 sportz is fully loaded feature car with price range of 7 lacs it gives more then feature which any other company will not provide. but only thing is that fuel economy is very low.
Hyundai;Grandi10;9 May 2019;Vineeth Kumar;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I own the grandi10 automatic. The car is 9 months old and i have driven 9900 kms till now. The car is a great automatic. Very zippy and responsive. Mileage is pathetic and my car gives on 11-12KMPL. However, SERVICE COST IS EXPENSIVE!!! For the free service they are charging 7200 INR not 1800 as mentioned in zigwheels. SO FREE SERVICE IS A SHAM!
