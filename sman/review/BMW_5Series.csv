BMW;5Series;10 Sep 2019;Anil Roy;4.3; Family Car ;Over the years I have had the good fortune of owning a variety of brands- Maruti, Hyundai, VW, Skoda, Mercedes and most recently BMW 5 series, which undoubtedly is the best driving experience. I like to drive and the 5 series is sheer pleasure. However, BMW‚Äôs dealer in Ranchi is not a shadow of who they represent. Here‚Äôs my experience: they started on a high note- unrelenting phone calls until payment was collected. They give me a date to take delivery. Since I live in Jamshedpur (about 170 kms from the dealership), to make sure before arriving, I ask for a copy of Temporary Permit (TP). They go -that‚Äôs not done yet but ‚Äòchalte hai‚Äô- everyone takes delivery without one. I ask how about insurance cover, God forbid, in case of an accident without TP. They say- that‚Äôs your risk! Obviously, I postpone the delivery until the following week when they confirm that TP is done. On the day, after a flimsy ritual of (third class) cake cutting ceremony, they hand me the keys with a photo copy of an un-signed, un-stamped TP! As much as I am aghast, I have no option but to drive a new car with technically no legal paper of registration and ownership. They promise to have the signed copy of the TP sent within 48 hrs, which after 41 days I still haven‚Äôt received!Now, here‚Äôs the kicker- my TP expired on Aug 29 and the car has no registration; hence a 60 lac car now sits pretty in my garage while I use a Ola to get to work!So in summary BMW ought to do better in their selection of dealership, lest they risk erosion of their hard-earned brand equity. To all the BMW lovers in Jharkhand and Bihar, stay away from Titanium.
BMW;5Series;15 May 2020;Ganesh Khade;4.0; Family Car | Occasional Commute | Daily Commute | Tours ;Car performance is good but i am not happy with bmw services at all. Worse experience than anything you will get here in osl prestige kolkata that also paid.all credit goes to mr.dilip paul,.these guys have given me headache by their fake promises and pathetic service ,i have puchased bmw 520d luxury demo car from here..and trust me, this guys were laying about delivery from 1 week after full paym ent to almost 1 months ..they said every scratches will be removed and same area will be repaint, so they have done it like anyone can make out the difference in repainted area..not professional work from bmw service center..they have painted my front bumper like kid playing with spray gun. Shame on such big brand..scratches are not removed from car i don't know how they can behave like this with bmw reputation.very disappointing.,please don't buy anything from this guys..you will regret..like me.shame on you osl prestige for fooling customers, i have posted some photos of repaint job please check on osl prestige reviews.
