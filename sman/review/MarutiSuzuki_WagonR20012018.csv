MarutiSuzuki;WagonR20012018;18 Jan 2019;APURVA RAI;3.0; Family Car ;Before deciding to buy WagonR I owned a Maruti 800. The "people"s car" brought many cheers in the family just like it has been doing for decades. After initial happiness we felt this is not sufficient for us and the reasons were many.We zeroed in for WagonR for various reasons. First and foremost was height. Tall boy concept made stepping in and stepping out much more easier than the M-800. Second ly, height provided better outside view particularly the driver.Second reason was large cabin. Once inside the vehicle you felt as if you are traveling with your family in a small compact room.Third factor was boot space. M-800 was good for city drive and your everyday shopping needs but not when you were travelling to another city with the entire family and the luggage. This is where WagonR suited most. Better boot space means you can attend a wedding in another city with your family.Even though I never admired the looks of WagonR I decided in its favour because of some useful reasons it offered.Even today I do not regret buying WagonR as it has given me great company and added an important symbol of status to my life.WagonR with 1.1 litre engine is better on highways than city. While driving in the crowded city like Delhi/NCR with air-conditioning on it is nightmarish to look at the petrol guage. However the vehicle is thrifty on highways. Even servicing is not reasonable. Labour cost, spares etc make sure you end up paying a good amount.As my needs have gone up I do not find its boot large enough to meet my expectations. One large suitcase and then it"s full leaving you worrying for more adjustments. I also felt that WagonR should have been fitted with larger and wider wheels for added safety.On an average this is a good first vehicle or a second family vehicle.
