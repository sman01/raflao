Tata;Safari20052017;12 Jan 2019;Sunjeet Kumar;3.0; Daily Commute ;After owing and driving for 8 years I find this car is good for 7 person all can get in and out easily and travel together but as my SAFARI is old model it lags engine refinement has too much engine noise doesn't has abs ebd airbags body roll is too much while normal drive as its too high above ground etc. Mine is 4x2 model but still I use in some little sluggish mud and sand areas and I am able t o get out from such situation. As its a big SUV so parts are big and expensive also very hard to get original. Like my EGR valve is not working.I am forced to use without EGR valve.The build quality is not so good either. Average is too low in city you will get 8kmpl and on highway 10kmpl.The clutch is placed too high and is hard always no matter if I get new clutch set within a month it gets hard I always buy TATA genuine parts from dealers. For a 6ft height person like me you sure will get pain in your ankles and knee cuz the SAFARi needs change in gears frequently it can not pull you out even 3 rd gear if you are in speed of 20 to 25. the engine will start hesitating making you to shift to lower gears which makes the driver restless while driving.I have driven 8 to 12 hrs continuously which makes me too tired. Its just feel outdated and boring and feels a burden of owning such car.I suggest anyone opting for 7 seater SUV just go for compact SUV 5 seater for max 5 to 6 years and agian buy a new 5 seater SUV beacuse in todays price of 7seater suv you can own 2 different types of 5 seater compact suv each for 5 to 6 year which would be equivalent to one 7 seater suv in terms of price plus you always have an updated features in your car for life.

Tata;Safari20052017;13 Feb 2020;Suresh Kumar;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;A palace on wheels. It is very comfortable and I enjoy each ride thoroughly. The 3.0 ltr engine has lots of low-end torque and the turbo kicks in at 1000 rpm. The suspension is superb for cruising as well as for city rides. Spare parts are costly since the tax on parts for luxury vehicles is quite high. There is lots of legroom and headroom, so tall people will never complain.
