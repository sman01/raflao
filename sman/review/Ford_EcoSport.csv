Ford;EcoSport;8 Jan 2021;Abhiraj Jit;3.7; Occasional Commute ;The ford ecosport is an absolute beast in the sub compact suv segment because of it's great safety and performance.Safety is uncompromised on the car and it's build quality is better than many of it's rivals like the kia sonet, Hyundai venue and the maruti vitara brezza.Mileage on the car is not great because it's nearly 7-9 kmpl but it doesn't matter very much because the ecoboost is absolutely p henomenal engine in terms of performance.When the car is reved at high rpms, The whistling is like an aeroplane and it cannot be called an underpowered engine.Comfort level is not as great as the urban cruiser which is actually the vitara brezza but still it's okay as the ecosport is an enthusiast's car more than a family car if the ecoboost is preferred.
Ford;EcoSport;20 Jan 2021;Vinay Prasad;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Its a real suv feel inside the car, Lovely for long drives, Excellent steering control on highways and in city too.Mileage in city is around 16.5 kmpl and on highways is 21 kmpl.Looks are understated and the feel amd spaciousness inside the cabin is very good, With a sporty dashboard and consoles.The cabin air filter is very nice as it blocks most of the dust and keeps the interior clean.Really im pressed and would definitely recommend ford ecosport.
