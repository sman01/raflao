Mahindra;XUV300;26 Sep 2020;Rutvik Gamit;5.0; Family Car ;As a basically everyone asking about milage. It gives 20kmpl as company says and it is not bad and safety features you know about by broucher of vehicles and it's company website, Boot space is less if you take so much luggage but if you are not taking so much luggage so you have enough space and rear passenger seat have so good space even if from seats are moved back till it slide rear passenger can comfortably seat.overall it is good. Once driving is something strange happen mileage is showing 22kmpl.

Mahindra;XUV300;18 Sep 2020;Xzebra Kingdom;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Very powerful car. Has good road presence and very comfortable. 17 inch tiers are just beautiful. Boot space is a bit of a problem but all over this car is a beast. On highways this car drives like a boat ,130-140 kmph no problem . No body roll very stable . This is the best sub four meter car in the market. Very proud of mahindra for introducing this top quality car in India.
Mahindra;XUV300;3 Jan 2021;Akshay B;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;If you can't afford compact SUV like Creta, seltos or hector.

Mahindra;XUV300;25 Dec 2020;Kamal Bhatt;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;After running 1year /15000km.. mileage avg 14.5.. no other issues with car no breakdown .. no unwanted vibrations .. mahindra service is ok... comfort wise its bestbin segment... sometimes you feel disappointed due to limited bootspace but that's the thing you always knew.
Mahindra;XUV300;4 Oct 2020;Dr Prashant;5.0; Daily Commute ;Satisfied with the cars performance and comfort till now (9 months ), Although service centres response is not satisfactory, e.g. poor fitting of accessories, number plate was also loose and vibrated, but the car is so good that i will tolerate them.
Mahindra;XUV300;27 May 2019;Priyansh Cho..;5.0; Tours ;Being a tall person i have always admired cars which are good in ground clearance and offers the best interiors considering the price too. Xuv300 is the perfect car i have purchased, most astonishing feature giving a luxury feel are the LED light signature DRLs, the cabin is quite roomy with best in class headroom, kneeroom and lots of spaces to keep stuff.the 1.5 litre turbocharged engine deliver s best in class power and recommend more of people to buy it
Mahindra;XUV300;24 Dec 2020;Kamal Singh;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Gear shifting specially in 1 and 2 gear is not so smooth.Gear knob vibrates some time.Engine noise is also not less as compare to other petrol cars.Milage 8s pathetic.Also the comfort of driving is not as it should in car of worth 13.5 lakhs.
Mahindra;XUV300;15 Jun 2020;Aniket Bandral;4.3; Family Car ;Over all its a great experiece with XUV300 . The only drawback is milege. . You'll get a mileage of 10 to 12 in the city . And 14 to 15 on highway in petrol engine. Otherwise it is a great experice with it.
Mahindra;XUV300;8 Nov 2019;Rijesh Ram;2.3; Daily Commute;XUV300 NOT FOR CITY TRAFFIC As per experts from mahindra we should not drive this new technology vehicle in half clutch, it will burn the clutch unit. My vehicle clutch unit was burnt in just 3500km.
