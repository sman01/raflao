Only have issues 3 time Overheating once and engine wires getting old and having problm while driving it faster while on highway for 4 hour straight . And yes in last 5 year i only change oil and collent and. Tyre. That's all . But these days brakes cylinder needed changing and the wires system too .
Hyundai;Accent;4 Dec 2020;Pratham Nigam;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Diesels - 10000 kms doneHighway avg- 20.5City- 17Drive is comfortable, there is no drift as such. Only issue is that avg should be 23, the interior isn't thay good, it feels a little old 2014 kinda. Specially when dzire and amazre are giving such beautiful interios, driving is comfortable on long runs ans that's why most taxis prefer this

Ample power and minimal turbo lag. Cater well to the demands even till date. A good commuter with good build quality, decent mileage, above average performance for the benchmark in reference.
