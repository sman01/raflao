MarutiSuzuki;Zen;9 Sep 2020;Suryansh Rana;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;its overall a good vehicle but if you are looking for performance or acceleration or top speed then it might hurt you but yeah the comfort of the car is very good and you can easily fit in 5 people comfortably and there is a little harm in the back row but that doesn't matter and the AC is not that good as the cars now get but yeah in a proper weather not in the extreme summer but if there is a go od weather it works properly and the plus point is that this car got heater also which is very beneficial in the winter season and the overall look is not bad but it could be better like not if you modify it then it will look extremely superb like I am is always on this car and like music system I regret purchasing 2001 model because in 2002 model there is side view mirror on the both side and you get music system and power steering and wheel cap but in 2000 model you do not get a wheel cap neither music system naye the both side view mirror but yeah this car is overall suspicious I would say the trunk is not that big but its decent size Zen stands for zero engine noise but trust me the engine noise is maximum and the air and noise from the a pillar and the turnover is and the engine noise is not zero like something I miss in this car is music system and power steering rather than that the car is absolutely perfect for 4 people familythe major problem in this car is you will face in winter there is a starting problem in winter you might have to wait 15 minutes you just do self for 15 minutes after that it will start and I guess inemergency case it will a major concern you will face we have driven this car up to Shimla from nangal like it's almost 300 kilometres or more. But yeah it's almost 20 years I am dealing with the car. What's the most valuable car of that time but yeah if you are looking to buy a new car now a days my suggestion is that you go for the Kia seltos or the creta.
MarutiSuzuki;Zen;30 Sep 2019;Milw Aukee;4.3; Daily Commute ;This has been the perfect City car for me. I owned it between 2006 and 2013 and covered 97K kilometers with one major repair - a Denso alternator which costed me INR 3,700 including replacement labour !!! It was a wonderful value for money car which refused to give up.With a powerful 1.0 litre 4 cylinder engine on a compact light weight body, the car had enough power for the city to be driven arou nd like the psychedelic rickshaw-walla. Had power steering, air conditioning and power windows (front) which were more than sufficient for me. The only qualms were missing ABS. I do not remember whether it had driver airbags, but even with than, it could have never been a safe highway machine. Even while selling, the car did not disappoint me (high re-sale value)!Just love that car so much!!
MarutiSuzuki;Zen;16 Dec 2020;Anand Tom;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;It's an amazing pocket rocket that can pretty much take all the abuse you throw at it.Also maintenance and service can be done by yourself easily.Overall the car is a brilliantly designed car the only complaint i have is the really small boot space.Other than that its and absolute joy to drive both in cities and highway.Also it gives fuel economy on your driving.If you are first time car buyer thi s is a go to vehicle as it can show you the joys of driving a front engine rear wheel drive.Also this car is very easy to tune and can be done at a really low price as well.
MarutiSuzuki;Zen;19 Oct 2020;Manoj Tiwari;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I own this small pocket rocket with pride, because its my first car though i bought it second hand.
