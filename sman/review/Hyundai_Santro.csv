Hyundai;Santro;29 Sep 2020;Aakarsh Roshan;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I bought the new Hyundai Santro Sportz AMT (Anniversary Edition) in December 2019. The anniversary edition was a great choice as it had reverse parking sensors, dual airbags and reverse parking camera as well which the normal Sportz variant didn't have at that time. Also in the exterior there are black roof rails, black door handles, black ORVM'S and greyish black wheel covers. The car has excelle d in evey aspect except some. Now I would highlight some aspects and my verdict about them for this car. SAFETY- 3.5/5 as it has received a two-star NCAP rating. Still when you shut the doors you will feel that this car's build quality is good. Also you get dual airbags in Sportz AMT and Asta variants.COMFORT- 4/5 This is one of the main strong points of this car. You get many features for your comfort and convenience like Rear AC vents, Steering mounted audio and phone controls, 7-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple Car Play, 4 speakers etc. Some features for easy driving like Rear parking Camera, Reverse Parking Sensors, Good Visibility, Rear defogger etc. The reason I gave 4/5 in comfort is because it lacks adjustable headrests in both rows, no height adjustable driver seat, no tilt steering.PERFORMANCE- 4.5/5 It is a great city car especially due to its AMT transmission option. However, driving enthusiasts would not be a big fan of this 1.1l 68 bhp, 99nm engine. You will not get that exta punch but the engine is just perfect for this car. The engine is very refined there is almost no engine noise or road noise as it is a 4 cylinder engine. The NVH levels are very low which is again a good point about this car.EXTERIOR- 4/5 Well it is definitely a good looking car but it somehow reminds us of the Grand i10 or Eon. No doubt it has some different looks than the i10 or Eon. But it has its own charm which is also a great point about this car.MILEAGE- 4.5/5 I live in Jammu where there isn't much traffic like in Delhi or Mumbai. I get a mileage between 13 kmpl and 14.5 kmpl in city. In highways it ranges between 15.5 kmpl and 17 kmpl.OVERALL VERDICTThe santro has retained its 22 years old legacy in India with this new generation santro. It definitely gets a spot in top 3 cars in the segment. It promises a comfortable ride for a family of four or even of five up to an extent with decent enough legroom and headroom and that rear ac vents which add up to the comfort of the car. It definitely has to gear up a thing or two like driver's comfort and pricing. But still it is a good enough package for anyone with a budget of less than 7.5 lakhs (on road price) and the santro has really impressed me too.
Hyundai;Santro;23 Aug 2020;Chinky Arun;5.0; Family Car | Tours;my evergreen CAr forever even I have Vw polo... it's amazing performance look and speed and disappointed about mileage... same as polo I have groom space and dashboard clearance views.. easier to drive in cities and traffic.. I have used car for 7 years.. I have did only 3 service.. for 47,000kms ... Even its seconds Santro I purchased it runs like two wheeler anywhere in cities.. I have driven ka rnataka tamilnadu states in my car.. tirupati.. very less Maintainence.. no sensor problems.. but polo I faced many problems once water s done for polo car entire sensors will stop working for changing senor it' costing very high price.. polo users are one who handle their car safely. you can see many polo cars on roads which doesn't have any scratches on cars and they are only one who gives the car on periodic services and service records can be seen on car instrument cluster shows entire things.. Cruz'e control available on polo automatic climate control changes electric mirror steering adjust seat height adjust arm rest cool cabin and good leg grooms and stylish look Aero dynamics are good for performance and stylish.. if sensors are maintained good without falling in water it can be good enough for maintainence... ground clearance s less but use the cars in towns and cities.. village users don't choose the cars.. use traffic less route and junk roads it may hit under chase.. use good roads to improve suspension... gear shifting and steering are quite good n good pickup.. mileage is about 14.7 1200 petrol engine.. better than Swift cars.. polo takes race swift cars easier ... swift is not used by professional business mans.. users don't buy swift cars it's all taxi drivers and travelers using cars.. Indica swift are not so surprised cars for own board users.. many yellow board cars are Swift cars.. so everyone hates swifts Every 6000-7000kms need to service.. spare parts are low strength on Maruti Suzuki.. body quality of swift is very very poor... bolts and nuts fateners are like local parts... see the bolt nuts fasteners in polo car it's heavy and design of nuts and bolts locks becoz it have holding s***p and threading holes... but holding strips for polo are good tightened it cant remove easily by spanners.. it need pneumatic gun to remove the screws in vw polo..
Hyundai;Santro;10 Jan 2021;Vishal Sharma;2.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Getting a car in india is always special.In my case, I wanted to buy a beautiful new car for my parents.Spending hours of research, I finally closed santro sportz over tiago and celerio.My folks were extremely happy even though they were pushing me to get a second hand car only :) lets begin the customer experience from sales to after sales: i reached home after first free service.While reversing the car, I felt the clutch fell down or broke.I couldn't move the car and had to call the road side assitance (amazing service).But, Not a great feeling to send your new car by tow-truck in front of your neighbors.4 points bad customer service:1) they forced me to accept that i drive with clutch pressed.2) car was kept in service center for 3 weeks saying the crank shaft is broken and the part will come from korea.3) a welding was proposed on broken the crankshaft on a brand new car4) no temporary vehicle was offered to me even after escalating the issue to higher authorities as well.Finally, When i told them that keep the car and pay me daily compensation, They sent the car very next day.One year after above episode, Front glass has a crack.Service center says it can easily happen in winters:(overall i think it's a good looking, Feature packed car with driving comfort but pretty bad on quality and mileage.
Hyundai;Santro;18 Feb 2020;AKMDD Ken;3.0; Daily Commute;Prices of the BS6 Santro Hatchback would range from around 4.7 lakhs for the basic-spec model and 6.25 lakhs for top-spec variants. So this amounts to a price hike of about 22,000 to 27,000 depending upon the variant. Also, the Era Executive, Sportz, and Sportz AMT now are at a premium of Rs. 28000. However, the CNG variants remain unchanged. The new version will be powered by a 1.1 liter BS6 comp liant Engine that produces the same output of about 69 bhp and 99nm torque.k The other features and safety kit will remain the same apart from transmission 5-speed manual Gearbox and an AMT unit. Features such as rear parking sensors, reverse camera, dual front airbags, and rear wiper/washer, a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with the latest smartphone connectivity, front and rear speakers will be reserved for the top-end
Hyundai;Santro;2 Aug 2020;Alok Ray;3.0; Family Car ;पुरानी सेंट्रो एक मजबूत इंजन वाली पतली , छोटी और लंबे लोगों के लिए बैठने में सुविधाजनक ऊँची गाड़ी , जिसको किसी भी भीड़-भाड़ वाले इलाके में बिना ड्राइवर के सेल� ��फ-ड्राइव करके ले जाया जा सकता है । नई सेंट्रो अधिक चौड़ी और अपेक्षाकृत कमजोर गाड़ी है ।
Hyundai;Santro;11 Jul 2019;Hemendra Soni;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;I own a santro 1.1MT Era 2019 model. i decided not to go for a higher variant and customize the lower variant as per my needs. also i had a tight budget. I installed a sony touch screen system with reverse parking and apple car play compatibility. Also i installed fog lamps of the santro sports varient. as of now..i have clocked 10000+ kms in three months only. the car has a decent performance on highway and city as well on highway i have done a maximum of 133km/h approx. with minimal breaking and lesser clutch use and constant speeds...this is giving me a fuel efficiency of approx 24.5kmpl.. wich is more than expected. though this car is not as quick compared to its rivals such as celerio or swift... it is a very comfortable car and have an exellent amount of leg space of rear and front passenger as well...only thing i did not like about the car is the lack of power in lower gears. being a 4 cylinder car i expected more power at lower rpm"s. overall i am very happy with it.
Hyundai;Santro;8 Oct 2020;Sales;4.3; Family Car ;New launched santro is a good car. Average is also fine I bought this car in aug 2019, after year or so the doors are making a sound like as we are opening or closing a truck door. Horn also got dead but problem was sold when I took it to service center without paying a single ruppee. All in all car is good but I think Hyundai has compromised with quality.
Hyundai;Santro;29 Sep 2019;Lalram Ngheta;4.3; Occasional Commute | Tours ;My first Santro Xing arrived on 17.0212, my wedding day. After that I have used it a lot for commuting and touring, even on the worst roads.. it never let me down. The only problem was, even in the top variant, only the front glass were automatic while the rear were manual. And no parking sensors.
