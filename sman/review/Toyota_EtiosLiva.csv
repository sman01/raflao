Toyota;EtiosLiva;30 Sep 2020;Surajsinhaa ..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car;this has been one of the most reliable and comfortable hatchback I have drove in my family. It has never let us down , no matter what. maintenance is next to nil. the only drawback has been it's mileage. Had I baught a diesel motor I would have never parted or thaught of parting by this beauty. I am thinking of letting this go after it has been with the family for 4 years and 45k kilometres. it st ill looks the same as brand new. The colours are well and truly intact as it was when I baught it 4 years back.
Toyota;EtiosLiva;15 Sep 2020;Javeed Chesti;3.7; Occasional Commute ;My Toyota Etios Liva performance, mileage comfortable, everything is good I love my Toyota Etios Liva if Toyota will not stop making Etios my plan was to buy 2 Etios Cross and Liva with digital instruments cluster, leather seats, Automatic gear box, split seats etc, like one in Brazil Toyota I love Toyota in future I will buy a Toyota Landcruiser first generation Prado type ll
Toyota;EtiosLiva;16 Oct 2020;Ethan Fernandes;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Styling of this car is really well done. Performance is good, because of the light weight. 170 Nm of torque(diesel) it feels peppy. Very spacious, can sit 3 people easily at the back seat. Downsides are very less features and alot of hard plastics and cost cutting materials in cabin. Cabin insulation is average and Engine note is lovely.
Toyota;EtiosLiva;8 Aug 2018;Sumit Dnyanesh;3.7; Daily Commute ;First gear and second gear pickup could be improved. Probably something like SOHC configuration which helps lower end torque. Upper body and bonnet and door material(finishing) is very ordinary because outside noise is noticeable including engine noise. Distance to empty is must to have feature in petrol cars at least. Safety is at its best along with seating arrangements. Interiors looks above av erage. Servicing in Toyota is no doubt much better than any other brand. Headlight is single beam but does its job in city area (on highway one will need fog lamps or HIDs). Cars sound in cabin is considerably higher than other petrol cars in India.
Toyota;EtiosLiva;18 Apr 2020;Praveen Bala;4.3; Family Car ;it is one of the best hatchback ... although some may find it's interior bland but it's a matter of choice that you want a safe and reliable car or just show off ... I will recommend this car toonly those who have some substance in them... and don't quiver for materialistic things
Toyota;EtiosLiva;1 Nov 2018;Gulshan Dagar;4.7; Family Car ;I am driving Etios Liva VXD last six months. Continuously I have drive this car upto 800 km non stop with any average speed of 60-70 kmph. No issue faced. car is most stable on road and quick response of engine. Comfert level is quite good. Value for money car.& it is best car for small famlies. Truly said go for it. As compare to Maruti swift its far batter in build quality. But Maruti gives more features. as per me this car need some up gradation i mean to say that there should be more features in it.
