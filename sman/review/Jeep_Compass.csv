Jeep;Compass;8 Oct 2019;Dr;2.0; Daily Commute | Family Car;I purchased Jeep Compass Limited Plus on 1st of July 2019, and within 15 days (vehicle not even driven 500km out of which 300km on first day) lot of annoying sounds audible from sunroof, dashboard, doors (maybe from C-pillar) and now from suspension. I am in continuous contact with Mr. Mike Manley, Mr. Kevin Flynn, Mr. Mangesh Kodalkar, Mr. Lokendra and their team through email. After approximatel y one month their team came to record video and they accepted the faulty things and they took my vehicle to dealership/ workshop for 7 days and even after that problems not resolved dashboard problems enhanced. I requested them to replace the faulty vehicle they refused. I said the reason behind the request is that the faulty components was installed from company end and not from customer end. Now their team worsen the things and I am forced to go legal
Jeep;Compass;26 Aug 2020;Venkataraman..;4.7; Tours | Family Car ;I am extremely happy with the Jeep Compass 1.4 MAIR DDCT I bought in Feb 2019. I have taken in on long drives to Chennai and Hyderabad. The handling is unparalleled with confidence inspiring manners and stability. The build quality is excellent with built to last feel. I have got 14 kmpl in highway section and 8 kmpl in city. The mileage drops to 6 kmpl in extremely short runs. I sorely miss the C ruise Control feature which, in my opinion, is a significant shortcoming. If FCA can offer retrofitting this feature for a price, I will be first in the queue!
Jeep;Compass;17 Jan 2020;Gagandeep Ch..;4.7; Daily Commute;Diesel 2.0 litre Bs4 engine with manual transmission offers a great performance with strong midrange. There is some turbo lag in low rev. Steering is precise and quick, chassis is stiff, so overall very sporty and enjoyable on highways. For city is also good but slightly heavy clutch. Main thing is tighter cabin space just enough for 4 pax and just enough boot space. Build quality is solid and no squeaks after 20000 km in 1.5 years. Maintenance is every 15000 km and first one costed less than 10K. Overall satisfied
Jeep;Compass;16 Jan 2020;Joydipta Ray;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Very good build quality and plush interiors. Many features not given in the top model for India which is sad. It's pretty zippy when pushed hard. The DCT is sluggish during sudden deceleration and one can hear the shift mechanism hunting noisily. Monocoque chassis makes it's stiff for off road use while keeping the in cabin nosies to a minimum. Remote start and AC, crusty control, electric boot op ening, open door warning lights and passenger seat electric adjust are features that have been missed out ðŸ˜’
Jeep;Compass;13 Jan 2021;Sree kumar;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Comfortable but not a plush drive, Mileage was as expected, With 12ish when driving for speed, And around 14is for mileage.The engine performance was a delight as expected and the vehicle is really stable even at high speeds and comes to a quick steady stop when braking.
Jeep;Compass;19 Jun 2020;Yogesh Vyas;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car;Have driven more than 20000kms in one and half year. 60% highway 40% city drive. Build quality is solid. It is fun do drive specially on highway. NVH is very good. Interior quality feels premium. Driving is my passion so execessive features are not important to me.
Jeep;Compass;1 Dec 2020;Philippose K..;5.0; Tours ;Handles like a dream and glides over bad roads like they don't even exist.And it has torque to spin irs wheels in mist gears with the traction control off.An average economy of sixteen kilometers to the liter just makes it a dream.Jeeps service is great too.
Jeep;Compass;17 Feb 2020;Shobitro Cha..;3.0; Tours;It is the best compact crossover SUV sold in India. It is better to choose Jeep Wrangler. It might cost high but Jeep Wangler is the best jeep sold in India and very good for going on bad and rugged roads or off road.
Jeep;Compass;7 Nov 2020;KRUTARTH KISHOR;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;IT IS A GOOD CAR BUT IT COSTS YOU AROUND 70K FOR 75K SERVICE WHICH IS TO HIGH AS TO SPEND 70,000 FOR 75,000 KM IS HIGH BUT OVERALL PERFORMANCE,SAFETY,FEATURES GIVE ME FEEL OF A LUXURY SUV.
Jeep;Compass;21 Jul 2020;Rahul;4.7; Daily Commute ;One of the best SUV in this segment. Packed with lot of premium features like Cruise Control, Panoramic Sunroof, Memory Seats, Electronic Parking Brakes, FSD, Rain sensing wipers, Tough body.
Jeep;Compass;18 Oct 2018;Tikka Bimbrahw;2.7; Tours ;Too many flaws. Poor headlights. Bad second gear, stalls frequently despite being careful, deep and clanking clutch and poor ride quality on bad roads and doesnâ€™t live up to the either the hype or its brief. Inconsistent ride quality and non linear engine gear box combo .More show than go
Jeep;Compass;6 Dec 2018;Design Vanguard;5.0; Daily Commute;I have no issues with build quality and performance but when it comes to after sales experience Its a nightmare. there is utter neglect shown by the service centres. ii remembered my experience when I first serviced my third hand bike 20 year ago. :(
