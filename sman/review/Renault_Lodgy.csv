Renault;Lodgy;4 Jul 2020;Rahul Naik;4.0; Family Car ;Best mpv,engine is wonderful,nice mileage with power.service to be done in Renault service only.spare parts are not given to customers from Renault service.getting spare parts is a big problem, you have to depend on online spare parts.renault lodgy is my favourite car I love it's performance but service to customers is not appreciable.
Renault;Lodgy;15 Sep 2020;Nishant Banthia;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Wished a good interior and a better build quality. Has a punchy engine and good feedback from the steering. Comfortable 3rd row. Low on maintenance. In city i received 13 km/lAnd on the highway you can get 18 km/l easily. Renault could offer bigger wheels for better handling. And not to forget it has amazing breaks too.
