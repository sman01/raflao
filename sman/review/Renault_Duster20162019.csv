Renault;Duster20162019;14 Oct 2018;Soham Khamaru;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Duster is to my notice is the only car that amazed me from Renault family. . I am a crazy driver who loves spending like whole day behind the wheels... I get a lot of confidence in highways espicially attacking corners or city drive when i am in a rush .. my pops bought 85ps rxz model... but 110ps was an if statement.. engine noise is a minimum.. the dashboard looks oldish with black plastics... i nfotec need to be rallied to match the market. bootspace is amazing considering its segment... talking about body outlooks its has simple but muscular outlooks bumps at the front n back secctions of the body where tire protudes..driving over in city all i can say these bumps need to be talken under notice or else scratches might happen .. this what makes me unhappy .. height is adjustable.. one advice if u r driving in highways keep the seat height low to enjoy it better. suspension is good till now to my notice
Renault;Duster20162019;20 Jan 2021;Vignesh Kumar;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Maintenance cost are very high. But if you are performance oriented person then this car is for you. It doesn't offer top class features. What it gives is good ride quality, high stability, confidence to perform what to like and mileage. Yes, my car gives mileage of at least 16 in city and 18-19 in highway.Features oriented people please neglect this car this car is not for you. Place explorers, t his car is for you. Make it dusty😜.
Renault;Duster20162019;12 Dec 2020;Ashley Dias;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Very well balanced in terms of its price, Power, Fuel efficiency, Maintenance and overall external design proportions.The ground clearance, Boot space, And ride quality is beyond compare.Features particularly safety features, Interior design, Cabin noise insulation could have been better.Overall a rough and tough car to handle indian conditions and equally suited while driving for a formal occasio n or a family picnic.

Renault;Duster20162019;28 Nov 2020;Deviklabs;3.7; Daily Commute ;Excellent engine but poor interior.Parts are two expensive i used 1lack km in 3 years.And during this time encountered two big engine issues.Although everything was covered in warranty otherwise replaced part was 40k.
Renault;Duster20162019;16 Jan 2020;Dinesh Rao;4.0; Daily Commute ;Its a great car with total control, only the clutch is hard and the length is little more which creates parking issues, otherwise no parallel in my opinion. As I have knee problem, I am going for automatic version.
