MarutiSuzuki;SwiftDzireTour;8 Dec 2020;Saurav Wadhwa;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I got the maruti suzuki swift dzire, 2008 model, In 2012, It was a premium sedan at that time and it had power windows, Reverse parking sensors interior wood trims which complemented the car.But after driving the car on the roads of mumbai it wasn't as pleasant, The car didn't take the bumps very, As compared to an ertiga.The performance is good enough for city or highways, Can easily drive up to 140 kmph, And has great acceleration.My car also had airbags and many other safety features as standard which still in 2020 makes up for it being an old car.
