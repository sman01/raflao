LandRover;DiscoverySport20152020;2 Sep 2019;AMRISH CHOPRA;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;In general it is an excellent car, very well styled but it has a major problem. Its driver seat is very badly designed, I have Discovery Sport HSE 2019 model. It is just not possible to set it to a comfortable position. In long distance driving, seat creates pressure points and restricts blood flow to legs resulting in swelling of feet. JLR refuses to accept the problem. When you sit on the driver 's seat, no matter how much you adjust, knee joint is higher than hip joint, a sure shot recipe for back and leg problems.
