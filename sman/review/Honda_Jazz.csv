Honda;Jazz;7 Dec 2020;Rajesh R;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I have been using honda jazz petrol top end automatic for 1.5 years now.Though i am very fond of this car i am quite disappointed and feeling sad to be honest and write some bad reviews about this car.Cons:* initial pickup is bit low* ac is the worstest ever one can witness in the cars.Even with high speed blower it does not make the entire cab feel chillness.In summers you will feel as if there i s no ac in the car at all* very hard to drive in the rain and fog.Mist does not get cleared at all easily.You need to keep highest temperature with full speed blower and ofcourse with front mode to clear the mist on the windsheild.If you reduce the temperature again mist will be covered in couple of mins.One cannot drive the car in rains with heater on for hours.Its a huge drawback and endanger to lives.* maintenance cost is high* battery which came by default did not last for more than 1.5 years and had to change brake pads and rotors for 25k kms only.Pros:* excellent comfort* spacious* good suspension* excellent road control even at 140kmph* boot space* build quality* engine smoothness.
Honda;Jazz;8 Oct 2020;Sivasaravanan S;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Honda Jazz Petrol CVT - Really a nice family car. I drove around 46000+ Km in 3 years and no issues at all. Servicing costs within limits -Rs. 3000 - 5000(approx.) / Service-> Thanks to Sundaram Honda for their Genuine service billing unlike other dealers. The best part is, refined engine with CVT makes the car to reach speed of 100 Kmph even below 2000 RPM and that is getting translated to me in terms of mileage and smoothness.
Honda;Jazz;27 Dec 2020;Krishna Chai..;4.7; Family Car | Tours ;Ivtec is butter smooth and one should have to go through a little learning curve to open up the performance, Which is like any other car.Absolutely comfortable for family of four.We never get tired even after long hours of journey.Am saying this after numerous journeys did ~600-800 kms per day and overall run of ~55000 kms.
Honda;Jazz;29 Oct 2020;Revati Ahuja;1.0; Daily Commute;Just a warning for all the upcoming honda jazz owners.The headlights have a focussing issue and the intensity is poor.Worse than there brio which is making the driving experience a difficult one.Kindly test drive it at night to know what i am saying.Only the top variant has the led lamps like all other honda cars.

Honda;Jazz;10 Sep 2020;Arun Rajan;4.0; Daily Commute ;To me this car is an absolute heaven.Such a breeze in heavy traffic and equally impressive for highway drives.Mine gets to sixty miles per hour in second gear itself.When the signal goes green and the traffic fades away on the rear you know you are in a special car.Also it humiliates much bigger sized sedans due to its impressive acceleration.
