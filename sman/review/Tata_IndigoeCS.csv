Tata;IndigoeCS;4 Jun 2020;Shubham Raj;3.3; Occasional Commute ;This car is very right choice of me in budget of 6 to 7 lakhs. In this small budget i enjoy the ride of a sedan car.also the mileage is superb according to its body weight because it,s a tata car so there is no tention of build quality.also the mileage of this car is superb according to it,s body its gives around 20+ mileage in city and on highway you get 22 to 23 kmpl and i you ride under 60 kmph on highway you will get 25kmpl of mileage by this car also the maintenance cost is good according to it,s body and also rhe spare parts available everywhere of this car.so this is very efficint car for those people who want to tke enjoy of sedan at the rat of hatchback.
