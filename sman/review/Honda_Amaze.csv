Honda;Amaze;11 Aug 2020;Rajat Sharma;4.0; Family Car ;I purchased Honda on the year it was launched 2013 (Purchased Dec 2013). It's a budget friendly car & gives me good mileage. City 14-16 kmplHighway 18-19 kmplService cost approx 3200-3500 per yearInterior - Basic (Very Simple)Exterior - BasicBoot Space - OKMusic System - Very Good (Simple)Ground Clearance - Ok (Depends on the rider though I drove it in Hills area & haven't yet faced any kind of pr oblem yet)Cons - Chasis is not so heavy so whenever you drive at speed of 100 above & then tries to reduce the speed by switching gear & reduce speed simultaneously in short time it's body gets j****d but only it feels to the driver. I thoroughly studied it & found that due to light weight chasis it gets j****d otherwise it's pick up speed is very very good.
Honda;Amaze;25 Jan 2019;Amal Das;4.0; Family Car ;Amaze can"t overcome hills.Low power is main issue I found and it"s only in petrol version.I am also one of the happy customer of Honda until driving a hill or ascent.Amaze can"t overcome ascents.Its the only issue i found since driving 3000km,which is not an acceptable issue.When i contacted Honda they said its handed over to dealer,but the dealer informed Honda that they didn"t find any abnormal ity in my car which they accepted that Amaze has power issue and its for maintaining mileage once i was there at showroom.And when i asked dealer about their reply to Honda they said its made like that they can"t tell this to Honda,if we want to ride hills we must choose another vehicle and they can"t fit same Honda engine on both boat and car(just imagine my situation hearing this kind of reply from dealers).Really pathetic situation. So, dear brothers and sisters please don"t buy amaze petrol.If you like Amaze go for diesel.All other features in amaze are good.I choose petrol because i am not aware of this power issue and now suffering for my choice.My bad i have test driven Amaze but not on an ascents. When you people ask sales person about this power issue they will reply there is nothing like that,better have a test drive with the same sales person on a hill or ascent and ask him to stop car in middle and then move, you can experience what i was saying about.
Honda;Amaze;21 Sep 2020;Mahadevan Si..;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Man, this car is a performance beast. I get around 25 kms on highways (Chennai to Trichy) if I do not exceed 90kmps. It has excellent power of 1500cc four cylinder 16 valve DOHC. But maintenance is a problem. Every 6 months we will have to service it and the service cost around Rs.9000.- per service. once the car crosses 30000 kms, honda service people starting that you will have to change the clu tch plate, ( which is around Rs.35000/-), change the brakes (Around Rs,18000) after 50000kms starting telling that the shock absorber is to be changed. ( which is again around Rs.20000). The cost of the engine oil is also high around Rs.4000/- approximate which has to be changed every 6 months.
Honda;Amaze;27 Jul 2019;Suresh Sahad..;4.7; Family Car ;Following is a review on the Honda Amaze Petrol after 5000kms. Looks: The overall silhouette of the new Amaze is good. It now looks like a bigger car compared to the previous version. I am not a big fan of the thick chrome grill at the front. The headlamps are stylish. The rear looks good with C-shaped lamps and sloping roof.Performance: The engine is super smooth and the gears are slick. Frequent gear changing is required but the performance is good. The initial pickup is low to maintain fuel economy. The car feels best on the highway. Feels stable even at speeds of 120kmph.Interiors: The interior is spacious and comfortable. The beige and piano black finish looks classy. The AC is quick and powerful. The rear seats offer ample legroom. The door speakers produce good sound. Audio controls are present on the steering wheel. The boot is spacious at 420 liters.Mileage: For a 1.2 liter petrol sedan, the mileage is good. It offers about 18.5 kmpl on the highway and 14-15 kmpl in the city with AC.Ride and Stability: The wheels soak up most bumps effortlessly. The ride quality is good. The stability at high speeds is good and body roll is controlled.Overall: Value for money. Spacious interiors and boot space. Good mileage and ride comfort.
Honda;Amaze;9 Jan 2019;Bees Cmrit;4.7; Family Car | Tours ;1. Honda Elite Cars Rajahmundry delivery my car in time as they promised to me.After reviewing Swift,Xcent and Ertiga i decided to by New Honda Amaze.I have seen so may bad review in amaze but my friend who is service engineer of Top Brand told that New Amaze is best in segment . Also service cost is low as so many told that Honda car service is High.2. I completed my 900 KMS traveled continuously for 300 KMS i did not feel any discomfort while journey. But the same journey with Etois i feel so much discomfort . Normally when we travel in car we feel dizzy but with amaze while riding we feel as we are at home . AC is very good no need for Rear AC vent.3. From far its looks like Volvo car. Mileage is good got AVG 21KMPL with in local and Highway. Some reviews told there is a problem in reverse gear but it is totally wrong.4. yet to give to service 5. Pros:Lots of boot Space, Leg room , Audio is Superb when compared to other cars . Diesel engines are noisy but Amaze engine is low noise like petrol engine. AC is very good no need for Rear AC vent.Cons: Some told that it has no resale value. But with Honda Pre owned car and its brand its not a big issue it think.
Honda;Amaze;9 Nov 2019;Aman Chhikara;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Suspension quality is very poor. Honda Amaze has extremely soft suspension which results in high body roll and poor ground clearance.Build quality of both interior and exterior parts are very poor. External noise enters in cabin very easily. Engine quality is excellent but there's a speed limiter on 145KM/Hour which is for safety reasons obviously but it makes the car out of the competition when i t comes to the top speed.Overall I'm neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with it but yes, not happy with the build quality and suspension system. I have a 2017 model petrol SMT model.
Honda;Amaze;29 May 2020;Anuj Gupta;3.7; Family Car ;I have recently faced fuel pump failure issue . Car was parked and weekly I was doing start and running, battery was ok but all of sudden one day it did not started and cause was bad fuel pump. Its very sad that a car which we bought new has manufacturing issue of fuel pump failure. In case I would have travelling and then it happened then think how much painfully it would be.So later I called the service center and they sent their mechanic to replace new fuel pump without any charges.I urge Honda to recall all faulty cars of bad fuel pumps.
Honda;Amaze;26 Jun 2020;PRANAV JOSHI;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Great car. I've bought Honda Amaze SMT second model in September 2018. DSL. I'm fully satisfied with this car. By profession I'm in business of tours and travels. I've driven this car by me & my professional drivers about 75k till today. Maintenance is not so costly.fual mileage is also good. AC is also powerfulSome of to my drivers giving 28-30 kmpl. Some time in rough driving gives 20-25 kmpl. B y impression of good performance I've also taken another car same model, same veriant in August 2019.
Honda;Amaze;12 Aug 2020;Arit Dey;4.3; Daily Commute | Tours ;Overall performance of petrol automatic is great in the city. It has paddle shifts which are effective in hilly areas. Many complain about the low torque and poor pick up but it totally depends on how you control the car. Best thing about the CVT in the hills it does not decent back immediately in a climb when brakes are released. City average is 12 kmpl with ac on. High mileage is better. Service of Honda is fair enough. Car is very smooth and comfortable and engine is quite silent.
Honda;Amaze;6 Jul 2020;Varun Verma;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;My Amaze emt petrol is 1.5 years old, i am pretty impressed with the style safety design and performance of this car, but if you love to drive on mountains or if you need an instant pickup this car lacks this, pickup is one of my big concern over this car, it may differ to driver to driver, but i think this is one of the best compact sedan in this budget. I have to buy music syste wheel cover, and exterior accessories from outside it costs around 7-10,000.
Honda;Amaze;27 Aug 2020;Govardhan B;3.7; Daily Commute ;The Vehicle is absolute spacious and elegant. engine is always smooth. but the Dash Board and System is very odd looking and Honda has never changed the style and looks very legacy type.also, the pickup is sluggish but once it hits highway the engine runs like an Horse...over all i am happy but not that very much as compared to other cars in the market. they need to improve the style and Interior and keep up the mileage good.

Honda;Amaze;4 Aug 2020;Sathiyan Tha..;3.3; Family Car ;Mileage not as expected .Even though the company is claiming 19 kmpl ,it never exceeds 14 kmpl till date.But I do hope that mileage will increase after III service.Moreover I experienced very difficult when it happened to stop at the mid of uphill and then climb.The pick up is not as expected.However travelling in more or less levelled road is very comfortable and is also worth for the amount paid .
Honda;Amaze;21 Sep 2018;Chandan Seet..;4.7; Daily Commute ;I bought the iDTEC Amaze in January 2014, and have run over 1,10,000 KM over varied terrains. The Amaze is definitely the best car in its segment. With amazing performance and fantastic mileage, coupled with great road grip, handling and safety, this is the car you should look at over any other in its segment. The car handles very well on the highway and has more than enough oopmh to overtake any vehicle on the road. A super responsive engine, you will experience no turbo lag.Be vary of unnecessary service add ons though. When you give the car for service, they’ll try to get you to sign unnecessary “value add ons” like rodent repellent, etc etc which can add thousands to your service bill.
Honda;Amaze;26 Jul 2020;Mukund Krish..;4.3; Family Car ;Honda is a great car that combines style, safety, comfort and ease of maintenance. My amaze gives 12km in city and 20 on highways. Handling is very good. Maintenance is not a pinch, only thing is need to be aware of the Garage, Hope a Honda EV comes out fast.. Hear that they are getting out a Jazz EV. If the same Jazz looks are maintained in the EV model it will be a hit.
Honda;Amaze;26 Oct 2020;Manish Yadav;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Haven't driven much. But still, feel the car can respond to my driving moods n requirements. City highway. Smooth and hard. Haven't pushed the car much. But in two situations it behaved stable n powerful. So liking it gradually. I also drive an XUV 500 and have been driving 2 small cars Santos and Altos. So I expect a lot from amaze. Hope it amazes me.
Honda;Amaze;24 Sep 2020;Deepesh Saini;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I purchased honda amaze in thr month of Oct 2019. Now almost a year I must say the car is great. It gives Mileage easily around 15 to 16 in city and 19-20 km/l in highway. Very comfortable and spacious. Small issue is with the body of the car as its feels less strong. But, comfort, mileage, boot space, looks are good. Overall great buy.
Honda;Amaze;23 Dec 2020;Aritra Mitra;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Comfort and performance oriented car. Mileage could've been improved. It's fun to drive in city and also in highway. Love the styling after Honda Amaze facelift. It's a great choice within 10 lakhs budget. A great alternative to Maruti Swift Dzire. Afterall Honda is Honda once the iv-tech kicks in, it's just adrenaline rush.
Honda;Amaze;10 Aug 2020;Hardik Gupta;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car;Best car in segment...The looks and features are amazing..my experience with Honda amaze is completed with 10000kms of running...The engine is powerful...just a point to notice that the car is not long routes as the steering is a bit heaving which makes the person feel tired faster...But the carr is awesome
Honda;Amaze;8 Oct 2020;Dr Pawan;3.3; Daily Commute ;Infotainment system of honda amaze BS6 in need of improvement.styling would be better in future.interior is comfortable.some features has to improve in this car eg.noise problem after 10000km drive,better infotainment features.overall it is better than other car in the respective range.
Honda;Amaze;8 Dec 2020;;2.0; Family Car ;The mileage has been very poor right from day one.! compared to a vw vento that i also own, I feel completely at risk when i drive this car because its handling is so flimsy, And it seems that it would go flying it someone were to hit me from behind - not very uncommon on our roads.!.
Honda;Amaze;29 Sep 2020;Dr Sameer;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Driving a compact Sedan like Amaze really amazed me . Its been 2 years driving this car i never found any technical problem with it even this is very easy to handle car. More you drive more you get in touch with it . Honda company has cons on features but pros on engine quality.
Honda;Amaze;9 Oct 2020;Simon Samuel;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Its a superb joy ride. I love driving my Amaze. Very responsive steering. The best compact sedan I guess. However not so good for a bumpy road. The suspension is on the softer side, so gives a premium feeling in a city ride, and even in highways, considering the road is good.
Honda;Amaze;20 Sep 2020;Abhijeet Singh;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am proud of me that i have own Honda Amaze because in this segment it is overall the best car in comparison to Dzire, Aura and other cars. It has been over a year that i have owned this car and there's no complaint against this. It's overall the best car in this segment.
Honda;Amaze;22 Nov 2019;Shiv Narang;4.3; Daily Commute ;Steering is oil controlled, and not power control. Similarly head rest in the seats can't be adjusted. Few cut offs every here and there. Better to opt for Honda City. Although it has the same 1.5 L diesel engine which goes for Honda City, which is big plus for performance.
Honda;Amaze;22 Oct 2020;Govardhan Babu;4.0; Daily Commute;Honda has always been and know for their engin while I drive I find it very smooth on drive with clutch and gear around. i drive it every day and till now no issues touched 74K KM and moves around like an year old vehicle.

Honda;Amaze;28 Jul 2019;Krishnendu Paul;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Owning it since 2016 october, petrol SMT version, really good car for city ride and long rides too. Given the road space in Calcutta, getting good mileage with a/c always on round the year, about 15-18kmpl and on the highways around 20-21kmpl. Doesnt get fatigued while driving this car in the city or in the country side.Value for money, if we keep the car with proper and timly servicing through th e honda suthorised service centers.

Honda;Amaze;9 Sep 2019;Vraj Gokani;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Driving on highway during night experienced less lights and power lag in 2nd shift more particularly 3 to 2,i.e. in downshift. DRL is required, but installing from after market runs with voiding warranty. Driving is comfortable and smooth. It give 12 km mileage in city and 20 plus on highway. GPS system is having older version, so it requires some up-gradation so that it becomes easy to find new r ide over bridges etc. Spare wheel should be of same size, it is of 14" and not alloys.
Honda;Amaze;6 Mar 2020;Siddhant Dhi..;3.3; Daily Commute ;over all amaze is nice car and honda service too. the car has good performance in diesel engine but amaze interior fiber or plastic quality is extremely bad quality and suspension is also not good enough
