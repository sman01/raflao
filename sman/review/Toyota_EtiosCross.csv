Toyota;EtiosCross;27 Apr 2020;Harsh Doshi;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Its almost been 3 ears since I own this car. I would just like to say, that if you are looking for a car in this segment. This is a car to go for. Spacious (for sitting) even healthy people can sit comfortably. The plastic body if very strong to absorb all the minor impact due to dumps and hits on roads. Your car looks with not be impacted as the black plastic will remain as it is with all the hit s. I accidentally jumped over a broken road during my trip to gujarat. I felt like driving a rally car. The car didnt had any damage (excellent shock absorbers).The seats are much more comfortable, the riding experience is excellent.What i didnt like:Small boot space Mileage (approx 13 on highway 9 in mumbai city - you know the traffic well)Spare tyre is a normal one not alloy
Toyota;EtiosCross;12 Feb 2020;Raynald Lewis;4.3; Family Car ;Very reliable car and has fairly good looks with the cladding. The only drawback is the low ground clearance due to which at speed-breakers it tends to touch the underbelly unless you are dead slow and maneuver very carefully.
Toyota;EtiosCross;14 Sep 2019;Vaibhav Rana;4.3; Occasional Commute;A pretty good car overall, the plastic outside doesn"t do anything but make it look rugged. It actually gets damaged really quick by the slightest thing. Otherwise a pretty good car
