Honda;Civic;12 Sep 2019;JNithish Fdo;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Love my Civic 1.8 iVtec The car is 12years old by 2019 and still feels like day 1 The engine has just done over 102000 KMs and the performance is just still surprising and exciting till date Has Loads of space in the cabin and The beige coloured Seats and upholstery gives a special airy feel The steering is slightly on the Heavier side feels like a task when pulling through tight gaps and small ro ads The headlights have an amazing spread but the intensity of the lights are just on the dimmer side which doesn"t feel so good and confident on the highway during night times so it"s better to go with After market LED bulbs just like I did and the experience afterwards is just blisteringly awesome City Fuel economy is around 11 kmpl which is quite impressive for the size of the engine and the power it offers highway fuel economy is around 14kmpl(110 cruising speed with boosts up to 150km occasionally) and can be pushed to 18 with Economic and conservative driving.Regular services do not cost much but tinkering works and any other mechanical parts replacement are gonna piss you off so be careful around Tight spaces and your driving style The ground clearance is not much of a con it only becomes a problem if you have 4 or 5 adults onboard and crossing speed breakers The car has an aerodynamic shape and which reduces Wind Drag and improves ride quality Fuel economy and performancePersonal Top speed of the car is close to 210 while company claimed and other sources say it can reach 225kmh The car has an incredibly low height which makes it mission impossible for elderly people to get in and get out The 6 speaker (4 speakers + 2 Tweeters) Honda audio provides a blissful experience with Aux connectivity The boot is adequately sized at 430L which I personally find as more than adequate (segment lower cars have larger capacity boots)With 50L of fuel tank capacity (5 reserve)Long trips can be accomplished without fuel stops
Honda;Civic;1 Jan 2021;Narayan Subr..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Very reliable.Not a thing has gone wrong ever since i purchased this car.Upgraded my infotainment system to the sony xav ax 5000 system thats android auto compatible.Performance is quite good.Upgrading from a santro, Needs a bit of getting to the acceleration characteristics.Needs a lot more throttle input, But once you get used to it, You'll find the engine is very responsive!gc is good, But the wheelbase being longer, Need to be a little mindful over breakers, But its not restrictive in anyway.Have driven fairly aggressively within the city and its never bottomed out.Really good service as well!.
Honda;Civic;25 Dec 2020;Sugandh Sriv..;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Loved this car but the only drawback is the lower ground clearance which is not according to Indian roads. A medium size speed breaker can also be felt with this car. I don't feel like driving it when I see path holes on the road. A higher ground clearance should have been anticipated by Honda for Indian roads.
Honda;Civic;3 Nov 2020;Pc Sharma;4.7; Family Car ;Overall performance of this car is excellent except average which is low it is driven only 30000+ kms in 14 years due to another car swift of 2007 model already sold after completed more than one lack kms.Now i want to buy one cvt car with best features like nissan magnite in cvt model.
Honda;Civic;22 Apr 2019;Richard Rozario;5.0; Daily Commute ;Usually, a lot of migrates go in for second hand cars. I don't understand the logic behind it. Could be that they haven't driven a car in India or wherever they came from. No issues with them. I had a Hyundai Xcel which was a 2 door hatchback. I happened to visit the Honda showroom in my city and found the Honda Civic- a European model hatchback that was up for sale. This used to be the demo car. I picked up the offer and I'm happy with it.
