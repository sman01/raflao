Mahindra;e2oPlus;3 Apr 2019;Nr Sridhara;5.0; Daily Commute;very economical just 75 paise per KM. I commute around 70 kms everyday. I just spend less than rs. 70 per day. zero maintenance cost. with petrol car I have to spend more than rs. 500 per day. I purchased this car for 7 lakhs. petrol car with same features like power steering auto gear cost nearly the same for ex. maruti celerio. After 5 years petrol car will sell at 2 lakhs or less. Assume that t his car price also would be the same. But with electric car I would have saved a petrol bill of 6 lakhs plus. car waranty including battery is for 3 years and I spent just 27000/- for additional 2 years warranty. so no fear of huge maintenance cost for 5 years. with all this is great economy and silent driving is superb. Car can be controlled precisely and it has features like hill hold and creepy features which helps to manage car with ease in bumper to bumper traffic. Excellent car .
Mahindra;e2oPlus;15 Nov 2020;Partha Pratim;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Excellent car to own and drive in city . Easy and quick charging. Yes need to be careful about how much charge is left but the car has never let me down. Have driven more than 15k kms in mumbai in less than 2 years and totally worth it . Looking forward to upgrade to xuv 300 electric version that is due soon
Mahindra;e2oPlus;21 Sep 2020;Alhad Sabadra;2.3; Daily Commute ;Most of the features provided are average. Not provided fast charges with every Mahindra dealers as promised O****Y BY THE SALEMAN ! Company LACKS COMPETENCE as far as customer care (?). TELEMATICS is average. In 40 months the app (now Nemo life) worked only for nearly 20 months !
