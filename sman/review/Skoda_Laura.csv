Skoda;Laura;28 Oct 2020;Prem Kamath;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;My Skoda laura has done over 2.25 lakh kilometers in the 10+ years that I've owned it and I'm actually very happy with it but because diesel has started getting phased out & some repairs have started being required, also I want to go for the latest Octavia or Superb. I'm planning to sell my car as soon as the lock-down over.
