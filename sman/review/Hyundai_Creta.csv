Hyundai;Creta;25 Aug 2020;Rajesh Vohra;4.3; Daily Commute ;I have Purchased New Creta 1.5CRDI SX(O). After Driving about only 500kms my feedback about car is really good. All features are really good EXCEPT TYRES. NEXEN TYRES are of really Inferior quality. I am truly unsatisfied by these tyres. In about driving 300Kms One of the tyres got bursted. I got it replaced from the service center. But Now after driving 200 kms more one of other side TYRE bursted . As a regular Hyundai Customer i did not expect this type of poor quality material from Hyundai.
Hyundai;Creta;16 Aug 2020;Shree dw;2.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Car is good looking and attractive thus purchased the SX manual but getting regret now on. It misses lot of safety and convince features. Engine performance is not enough, lot of down shift and day by day it looks like engine is getting poor. You pay a huge amount onroad for this but you don't get what you deserve, suggest alternative who wanna buy this. Mileage is also an issue everyone facing. T oo away from what Hyundai claims. I tried everything, I am not a rough driver and keeps car within economical limits and good smooth drives but still mileage is hardly 8-9 kmpl. You get bulky SUV but not an luxury and a powerful car. 1.5 ltr petrol engine is not for you if you want smooth comfortable ride.
Hyundai;Creta;26 Dec 2020;Kalyan Pichu..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I purchased Creta SX Diesel Manual before 2 months and had driven 6000 kms. I have driven the car both inside city and in highway. Car has been pretty amazing. Comfort, style and safety has been top notch. My total avg mileage has been around 20.6 kmpl. my top speed in the car is 190 kmph and felt amazing stability and very minimal vibration. Doors and body of the car is very steady and you can fe el it when you drive. Overall it has been an amazing experiance.
Hyundai;Creta;4 Nov 2020;Audi Rexus;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;creta is extraordinary in comfy and performance and also provides decent mileage and i go for it. I bought E variant and totally modified to SX at cost ~2 lakhs with Top end model TRIO HEADLIGHT AND ALLOYS. Sunroof and Original Music system are those two features i missed it! But i suggest you all to buy E Variant and modify. You can make SX model in just 14.5 laks
Hyundai;Creta;8 Jun 2020;Rishi kale;3.0; Daily Commute;On an average I drive around 1500 Kms a month of which 1100 kms is a Express Highway Drive. Despite trying everything like driving at constant speed of 100, maintaining the Tyre pressure, regular service and oil checks there is no improvement in Mileage. It is hardly 9 km /per litre . Company service station also seem to be clueless. Would appreciate suggestions.
Hyundai;Creta;7 Nov 2020;Utkarsh Singh;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;One of the most refined suv in the market it focusses on things that matter. In comparison to seltos and Hector, there's a lot less NVH levels which alleviate the comfort and reduce fatigue over longer distances. The engine is smooth and tractable. And the music system is great too. The car is a true family car.
Hyundai;Creta;5 Jan 2021;Green Blue;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I have base variant,in base variant there is no inbuilt music system and no inside front roof light's three two things want to upgrade for base variant,ride comforts are very good, you will like to continue the drive without talking any rest,it looks awesome, good mileage at diesel and not bad,loveable one.
Hyundai;Creta;11 Dec 2020;Jatin Kalra;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;awesome car for city drive as well as highway drive. Sporty looks and fast car. Best in segment and spacious car. Very big boot. awesome music sound. Low maintenance cost and high ground clearence. It gives around 20 km/l mileage for diesel automatic. Can go anywhere without any problem. Fun to drive car
Hyundai;Creta;5 Oct 2020;Simran Vats;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Very good car and I like it look and mileage and cc it is very good car and powerful car. This car is better other cars like kia seltos, renault duster, etc. This car was expensive but it has give us the best experience ever and now this car is changed but I also know that the changed one is also good.
Hyundai;Creta;20 May 2020;Kaberi De;5.0; Daily Commute;Awesome car. Makes a great and stylish appearance with many more features along with a turbo charged 1.8 litre diesel engine. In the diesel automatic variant the clutch is so smooth. Just go for it without losing1a single minute. üëçüëç
