Ford;Ikon;20 Apr 2020;DIYA DIL;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;very comfortable seats, perfect braking, control on higher speeds, best mileage in the class, city 20 kml and highway 24 even after 10 years. No major work done in this period, I'm little sad about its styling especially from front ,steering controls , seat adjustability etc. over all superb vehicle
Ford;Ikon;12 Sep 2019;Vivek Singh;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;I just love it, it gives me 17kmpl mileage on highways, i never had to spend a single penny other than general servicing. its still fun to drive. it was my first car and I have a very soft corner for it
Ford;Ikon;11 Apr 2019;Ajay Goswami;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;It's really excellent. Even after 11years/70000km running I don't want to dispose the vehicle. Now also I race the vehicle at 120km speed and get the pleasure of overtaking other vehicles on road. Every year maintenance cost is only once1for routine engine oil change etc. I shall drive another 4 years , even if I purchase a new Car. Salute to my1Ford Ikon TDCI
