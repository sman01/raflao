Skoda;Octavia;3 Jan 2021;Maddy 3030;4.3; Family Car;bought this Skoda's Octavia onyx in 2017 and will say apart from fuel economy, everything is just excellent, am not going by the service part as we all know it's rediculous, but by far the build quality, the power delivery,the electronic gizmos go they are pretty good, I have ridden it in all kinds of terrains and roads, liked it. now high speed stability is excellent, but has a bit of body roll o n high speed corner's, would I like to buy it again in 7 years time.... absolutely yes
