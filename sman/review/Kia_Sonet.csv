Kia;Sonet;18 Oct 2020;PrincePolo I..;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Canceled Venue SX petrol and waited for this and it was worth it. I got HTX diesel at the same ex-showroom price with all the additional features and latest interior & exterior. Engine 5/5Comfort, 5/5Space, 4/5 (4 persons in my family) Interior 5/5 (as per other options in the segment), Overall rating 4.9/5. The only downside is steel wheel caps not looking so great. We will change soon. The sh owroom guys won't allow for self-insurance/zero bargaining/long waiting if not pre-booked. Hopefully, I pre-booked the first day itself.

Kia;Sonet;4 Jan 2021;Dawa Negi;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I had purchase htx imt black colour variant and its been 3 weeks.. my experience regarding my variant is good...it looks very premium both inside outside..and is rich in features. Steel quality used is very good and i drove it 786 km. It has a very good road presence and if we talk about mileage it gives me around 13 14 km of average..
Kia;Sonet;28 Sep 2020;Amol Harsulkar;1.0; Daily Commute;POOR PRICING STRATEGY; KIA is trying to build in India but this pricing policies are unfaithful... HTE 1.2 & HTE 1.5 casting 8 L & 9.5 L resp does'nt hv Audio/2din facility... shame on the intentions of KIA ... failed to build faith in Indian customers.. KIA brand will not sustain in India...

Kia;Sonet;25 Dec 2020;Shivnath Paul;3.0; Family Car | Tours ;1.2 htx model not available in kia sonet which disappointed me.Rear seat also not much comfortable.1.2 htk+ needs to be upgrade in same price level such as leather grip steering, Rear arm rest, Rear thigh support seats etc.
Kia;Sonet;12 Oct 2020;Sachin Edava..;4.5; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;The car by far has the best in-segment looks and interior finishing. The other option that I checked out before this was the Venue SX iMT, which has way less features compared to this, except for the alloy wheels.
