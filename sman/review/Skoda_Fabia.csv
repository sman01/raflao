Skoda;Fabia;21 Oct 2020;Brajmohan Ba..;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;A great car with body material and have comfort to ride over highway, specially on long drive. But there is problem of original spare not available on every where and less no of service centre in many places.
Skoda;Fabia;8 Oct 2020;Kunal Mishra;3.3; Occasional Commute ;Good car but too much maintenance cost. Comfortable and design up to the mark. mileage is awesome. Due to less service station the maintenance is too dificult after 5 year in remote area.

Skoda;Fabia;18 Nov 2020;Suresh S;3.7; Family Car ;Best car.Strong body.Full safety.Very good mileage.Running pick up so good.Sudden pick up so slow.At the same time maintenance is too much.
Skoda;Fabia;27 May 2019;Debojjal Gupta;4.3; Daily Commute ;I would rate fabia 5/5 as the mid range of the car is much more responsive than the competition. Its a well built car. Fuel consumption is justified by the driving pleasure. No other 1200cc clutch has a similar feel.

Skoda;Fabia;13 May 2019;Prajith Jaya..;3.3; Occasional Commute ;Safety wise the car is best considering the year of manufacturing. Intial power is less considering a 1.2 l petrol engine( Very sluggish) . High maintenance. Performance in mid range is good I could clock 150 in highways. Highway mileage is around 14.
