Toyota;Innova;16 Dec 2020;Anand Tom;5.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;The 2013 innova 2.5v is a real joy to drive.Despite its simpleton mpv looks it's an absolute fun to drive this on the roads.Be it long stretches or sharp bendy corners or hairpins the innova will take on em like a boss.The drive of the vehicle is what i really enjoy the momment you are in the driver seat and turn the keys and fire up the engine 2.5l turbo diesel comes to life with a heavy rumble a nd bass.And if you are diesel head you will really enjoy this part especially.As you stick into the 1st gear and let the clutch loose the transmission of power is just instantaneous and linear and yet there is subtle balance in its delivery she just takes off into the road.Initially whenever i drove the innova i felt the lack of power.But it was due to my inexperienced and immature drive style that caused this.And the more i drove it.I understood the engine better.And rather driving it like a petrol engine i drove the way a diesel engine should be driven.And that is by giving enough and more revs while attaining the right speeds to shift.Also you needn't always be at a higher gear while driving this.Its all about keeping the mechanicals in their sweet spot and if you keep the engine in its sweet spots which are the bottom and mid ends the innova really becomes an amazing machine to drive.The steering is really precise and gives enough information as well.Although i find slightly more on the heavier side and also a bit of hassle in manoeuvring in tight sity spaces.But it is possible to take this car anywhere due to its streamlined body.Also this being a rear wheel drive makes the innova that much fun to drive as well.The drive of the innova is so good that it has enough acceleration in the 5th gear to keep moving forward in the highways, You can do a 1000km journey without a break on the innova.Infact it can still hold off against modern cars in terms of performance and can outlast most of the vehicle sold in todays market.Its a lot better than owning a south korean tin can that has so many fancy features and no real drive.
