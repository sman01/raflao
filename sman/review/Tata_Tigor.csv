Tata;Tigor;12 May 2020;Sandeep Chow..;5.0; Daily Commute;This is a surprisingly refined and fun to drive car. I have had the car for 18 months and have driven 15000 km. I bought it after evaluating the Amaze, Ameo, Dezire and Verna. On the highway this car has given me and average of 20.8, with AC running but top speed restricted to 100 kmph, on an expressway for 1200 km. In the city she has given me and average of 16.5. The engine is really very refine d and responsive. The power delivery is smooth through the entire RPM range; the gearing is very well planned. The top speed I achieved is 156 kmph (GPS showing 153), wherein the over-speed warning cut in. Even at these speeds, the engine did not run out of breath and did not sound stressed. The interiors are comfortable with ample headroom and leg room for all. The most outstanding quality of the car was its ride quality and handling. The handling is extremely cohesive and steering is very responsive with excellent cornering. The ride quality is very polished and the car gives the feel of much higher segment car. A few drawbacks though - the touch-screen entertainment system is not really that refined. It does not support Android Auto or Apple Car-play. The 'A' pillar is slightly large and the driver instrument display system is a little fussy. The ConnectNext (Tata in-house) app is really poorly designed and does not accord any benefits.Other than these minor faults it’s a smashingly great car and tremendous value for money. The faults listed have been addressed to a large extent (I believe) in the 2020 model. I am planning to buy another Tigor for my wife – it’s honestly that good!!
Tata;Tigor;3 Aug 2020;Shukur Reshma;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have driven my tigor xz+ petrol for a few thousand kilometers and i am very happy with my decision despite friends suggesting not to go with Tata cars. Everyone has their priority aspects while purchasing the car but mine was in the order of safety, comfort, price, mileage, and features. It has bagged 4 stars in NCAP for safety, it's suspension is very good as compared to the other cars in this segment, price is competitive, mileage it gives 20 kmpl (combined) in eco mode. It has the required features. I have driven in the city and went on long drives about 600kms. I feel confident and safe while driving. It never gave me any problem until now. Coming to the cons the styling is not very much impressive and it's a personal choice. While putting the reverse gear i need to apply slightly more force than the forward gears but for me it's ignorable since it's very slight and if I don't apply then it will be stuck in between. Car-related apps are not useful. Just for namesake, they are lying in the Android store. People say tata service centers are not good but i suggest to enquire and go to a good service center. And also you need to deal with the people who disesteem you for owning a TATA :), just be happy on your decision and ignore those people, also keep in mind every car has some cons be it a supercar or budget car.
Tata;Tigor;15 Jan 2021;Jayaprakash HJ;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Tigor is a very worthy car for the price tag. Had got it for 8lk for top end petrol. Now also its almost same even with more features and improved design. Less maintenance for sure. Almost half the maintenance compare to hyundai or vw.Mileage is bit of concern because the car itself is 130-150 kg heavier than the tin cans.But if you drive always below 90 kmph then, Highway mileage of 18 kmpl is gu aranteed with eco modeIn Bangalore city traffic i get 12 kmpl, in mysore traffic 14 kmpl with eco mode not city mode.For two years, i have driven 38000, maintenance has been around 13000 with 5 services. First 3 being labour free. I highly recommed this car for family people.
Tata;Tigor;15 May 2020;Vikalp Sriva..;5.0; Family Car ;A car which will satisfy you in every aspect. The bulid quality of the car is more than awesome.. and the comfort, features it offers at such reasonable price is awesome . And the infotainment system with those Harmon Cardon speakers will just blow your mind.. average of this car is totally depends on how you drive it. In city u will get around 15-16 km per ltr and in highway u will get 21-24 kmpl .. will recommend this car to everyone
Tata;Tigor;1 Jan 2021;Rehman;4.3; Family Car;Why people avoid buying tata cars? after visiting several dealers/ service centers, I a sharing my experience for buying tata car.The only reason is the customer relationship team (sales/marketing or service including tsm ) are very much un- professional.Not care the customer's feedback/ issue.Same as hind motor.You cannot expect the work as per their commitment.That is the one and only reason as i feel but tata's car is excellent.
Tata;Tigor;11 Aug 2020;Yogi 673;5.0; Daily Commute ;I think is the best car in its segment and when you know its from an home grown Indian brand then its more than enough. Only the suspension setup can make you feel like' paisa wasool 'Build quality will never disappoint you an any situation.its almost of same weight as of Maruti ciaz.Thats a big thing.Comfortable, handling and moreover its music system with 4 speaker and 4 tweeter...just wow..Love this car
Tata;Tigor;9 Nov 2020;RAVISHANKAR ..;4.7; Daily Commute ;Till now i have drived 1500km in 15 days, Overall bumper package, Look wize its compititors as well as desire and all too cant compare, It looks super cool.Performance is awesome, You cant notice when you reached 80-90, Its so silent.I am getting a 15kmlp mileage in city and 19.5 in highways.
Tata;Tigor;21 Jun 2020;Adil Belal;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;No unlock button for the doors even in the top model. AC fan when high makes a huge sound. The AC Vents, other fibres like those near gear and dashboard are lightweight, needs to be stronger. Overall nice look, nice performance. Satisfied. But needs some improvement.
Tata;Tigor;13 Aug 2020;Rahul Prasad;4.0; Family Car ;1) Low end torque is not good, overtaking in city is being difficult. 2) Electronics malfunctioning some times.3) service experience is not good from Tata motors.4) Ride & Handling best in segment5) Build quality is remarkable.6) Seat comfort better than its rival

Tata;Tigor;17 May 2020;Shubham Walia;4.3; Daily Commute ;Overall performance is satisfactory. Inside cabin smell like plastic burning when car is parked in Sunlight. Music system gets blurry sometimes immediately after ignition. Vibration in first gear. Mileage is good, about 18kmpl on highways(in first month).
