Toyota;CorollaAltis;3 Oct 2020;Prapanch Ravi;4.7; Daily Commute ;Such a pleasure to own a Toyota Corolla, it is a workhorse in the real sense of the word while carrying all the bells and whistles one could as for. The engine is frugal, responsive, and smooth and the cost of owning one is negligible. I use it like a mini-truck, never let me down, bad roads, bad weather. The last set of tires returned 87,000kms. Life won't be normal without a Toyota for me!
