Tata;Nano;25 Sep 2020;Jagadish Tal..;3.7; Daily Commute ;I m using the tata nano from last 6 years and i m still looking forward to drive it more It delivers a nic 17-18kmpl in city drive and 24-26kmpl in highway when i drive.I have till now changed only some minors things such as tyres ac condenser and front strut shock absorbers onceI wish it had a diesel engine at the same engine displacement like 600-700 it would given a mileage of 30-35 kmpl in hig hway
Tata;Nano;19 Mar 2019;Bhagath Sp;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I own Tata Nano Twist, 2014 Model. This car is less driven around 10700 kms till now. I had a other car so not much used. Yearly service was maintained as per the schedule. Car is good to drive in cities and i didn"t feel that bad as people comment on this car. Its a two cylinder engine, little noisier than other cars but its manageable. At this price point the car has some good features and it ha s excellent space compared to my other car(felt not to mentioned as i can purchase 2 Nano;s from its price). Nowadays it become my daily drive and i am really enjoying it. Cheap to maintain and its strong than it looks. little more feature like front disk breaks would be suggestible if they are again introducing it.

Tata;Nano;26 Dec 2020;Aniket Saxena;3.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;I purchased Nano as a second hand car. It's 2012 model and is comfortable foe metro use. I'm easily able to park anywhere I want. Last time I took a note on average that's around 24kmpl. It's amazing for a car. It's a cheap car but is practical for Indian road. I'm totally satisfied with Nano.
Tata;Nano;14 Oct 2019;Jahaangir Me..;5.0; Daily Commute;Nano is an excellent car and very comfortable to drive. I have the twist model for the last 6 years and no complains at all.it has power steering and power windows which are awesome. It is really sad that Tatas had to stop production of this dream car for Ratan Tata.

Tata;Nano;1 Dec 2020;Yogesh Gaykar;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Good car,value for money, engine has enough power and good milage, strong enough for its size.ConsStigma attached to it is cheapest car, Indian people want car for showing not for use.Thus a good car failed to impress Indians
Tata;Nano;30 Aug 2018;Sanjiv Kumar;4.3; Daily Commute ;Kids made me buy this car and even after 6 years. I don"t regret but admire the decision of buying it. Zero repair cost in these years and negligible service cost makes it a really-really economic car having all the comforts of an effective AC, very effective heater and enormous legroom with a small turning radius and more ground clearance making it A WHEREVER YOU GO Vehicle. Enjoy the ride !
Tata;Nano;11 Apr 2019;Ajay Goswami;2.7; Occasional Commute ;I & my wife especially use Tata Nano as standby Car. But we feel very comfortable while driving due to easy1access to get inside,specious, great visibility from driver seat. Intermittent servicing is required1particularly for Gear adjustment ,otherwise it is excellent due to it's easy maneuvering (Handling) and it goes very fast. Happy,not able to dispose even after 7years /38000km running.

Tata;Nano;13 Mar 2019;Parmod Khichi;1.3; Daily Commute ;Inferior feeling when drive, every one looking like why this car on road or symbol of poor people. One Lakh price promise of NANO is totally worth less. According to my opinions price may be high but add some features. Running engine makes so noise and shape of body is not good.
