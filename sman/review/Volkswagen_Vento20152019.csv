Volkswagen;Vento20152019;5 Dec 2020;Dr;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;The vehicle delivers close to 16 km mileage with 4 people and speed of 100 km/h on high way with heavy luggage.In city, May be around 10 km per liter.Excellent pick up and handling.Very safe car.Strong body.I have been parking my car next to sea shore, Still it hasn't shown signs of rust.Till date it did not invite much of maintenance cost (done 34000km only in 4 years).But, If something breaks in side the cabin ( plastic parts) like switches and all, Its very difficult to get them replaced.You wont get it! other wise it is an excellent car.Authorized service stations are few.Do not go for it of you aren't near any sow room service stations.I would also suggest not to meddle with any of its sensors and electrical systems like, Fitting extra lights etc.
Volkswagen;Vento20152019;1 Feb 2019;Shubh S;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have the vento automatic-my second vento - a gr8 and power packed vehicle. 1.5 litre diesel automatic TDI engine just makes it the top of the line sedan. Feature and comfort-wise the car is gr8. Driving this powerpacked car is a lot of fun but the only sudden problem is the mileage issue - the mileage has suddenly reduced after the first service check - dont really know what the problem is but e xcluding this issue - the vehicle is running perfectly. I do1 a lot of intercity driving so mileage on the highway is not an issue -approx 20 and #25 if drive @80-100kmph (self tested) City mileage approx 13-15kmpl.

Volkswagen;Vento20152019;9 Apr 2019;Francis Xavier;4.3; Tours ;A excellent car. Spares are very expensive. Annual service charge is too much. Some parts are of poor quality-brake discs, ac vents, wipers, ABS brake sensors and had to change fuel injectors twice(in guarantee period) arm rest upholstery peeling off. MY car is vento diesel highline 2011 has clocked 50000km. AC is not very effective. On the high way it is a pleasure to drive.
Volkswagen;Vento20152019;29 Jan 2019;Viren A;3.0; Family Car ;I have driven about 57000 km in 7 yrs. There are some design flaws in the car. They are :-1. No engine temperature / coolant gauge2. No manual door locks. In case of total electrical failure you cannot pick the car.3. Very soft suspension & less road clearance.4. Poor quality of plastics - radiator carrier tray keeps breaking, flimsy AC vents.
