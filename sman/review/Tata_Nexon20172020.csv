Tata;Nexon20172020;24 Oct 2018;Home Android;1.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Yes, it’s true the looks and features we became so much fan off, were not so smart features after all. In1plain and simple words the common-sense was totally missing from this vehicle.! Yes, you read it correctly,1the common sense is not their at all in TATA NEXON XZ+. First, the Dancing Mirrors…! Scenario:- You just1came out of your home and stepped in your car ….……as soon as you will p ush the “Start/Stop(SS) Button1only once…….your rear blower will start……? Dude I am sitting in the front…….you should have1started the front blowers….? As mostly it’s single passengers sitting in the Cars………so why the hell1in the world you are starting the rear blower first.? Strange it is……! Then for the Front blowers you1press the SS button once again……okay the Ignition is “ON” now, with front blowers….Good…….but1why the hell the Side View mirrors are opening……? I have not even started the car yet and maybe I was just1not going to go anywhere at all………but why the Side View mirrors are opening if I am not going1anywhere.….? Talked to TATA MOTORS……they said it’s a Welcome feature in Top variant……so can’t do1much about it…! Okay, then I closed the Rear view mirrors by pushing the inner controller downward….cool,1they are close now. Now, I start the Engine to go to my office by pressing the SS button(along with Clutch)1third time, engine starts….perfect…….Side View Mirrors open again…? Dude you just lost it…….It’s1insane……I am such a driver that never uses the Rear view mirrors, and always do the lane driving…….!1So, TATA engineers should have given some sort of disabling mechanism for Side View mirrors’ traumatic dance1moves again n again……! Keep it simple guys and don’t make a mess of such AI integration…….we are1humans and we don’t need such repeated welcomes by our daily ride……just for starting1engine…….twice……jeez.! Mockery of the SS Button? Suppose you have just reached somewhere, want to Stop1the car engine, and simply need to wait for someone……….and keep the Blower/ Fan “ON”……….dude1you need to press the SS button three times…….! Just to “Stop the Engine and keep the FAN ON”. Let me1do it for you…….First SS Button press shuts the ENGINE OFF(along with Ignition+ FAN+ Rear1Blower-everything “OFF”)……….Second Press, re-starts the rear blower…….Third press, re-starts the1front blower / fan for you…….now you can wait for your someone.……! TATA engineers could have just Shut1the Engine off and kept the Fan/ Blower running in the single press…….isn’t it simple and easy……!1But TATA don’t want you to wait for anybody in your car…….specially with your fan “ON”. Or be ready1to press it three repeated times…….! Second, the Central locking……again without common-sense….!1Guys, you’re just not safe in TATA NEXON specially the XZ+ model….yes the top variant is specially1designed for only those people who have enough of money to be targeted by robbers again and again……!1Don’t believe me…….just trying stopping at any red-light and ….and……and don’t try to STOP the1engine……….ever……ever……ever…….forget the fuel economy / environment pollution / fuel1conservation…………don’t Switch OFF your engine at any cost…….Because, the moment you will do1this…….NEXON has opened all the four gates for your being vulnerable to robbers outside your car…….!1THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST SHOCKING OF THEM ALL…….! It’s been one month now…….I never switched off my1engine at any red-light or anywhere other than my office or my home………I FEEL SCARED…….IN NEXON XZ+.1AS I CANNOT TURN OFF MY ENGINE ANYWHERE AT ALL…….I MUST, IMMEDIATELY PRESS THE LOCK/UNLOCK KEY DOWN BELOW1TO RE-LOCK ALL YOUR DOORS…….AND JUST HOPE THAT YOU ARE FAST ENOUGH THAT NO ROBBER/ MOLESTER / RAPER HOPPED1IN YOUR CAR YOU WILL START FEELING SAFE AGAIN IN YOUR CAR…! Third…….only until you open your drivers’1door unlock lever…….!? Yes, I travel mostly alone from my home to office and then back…….! The moment1I open my(driver) unlock lever….all the doors will open……? Dude this is not Central locking……! If I1need to open all the doors I will use the Lock/Unlock Button on the front console…….! I am just opening my1Doors lever to unlock and TATA has once again left you completely vulnerable……by opening all four1doors……! You can also add My Laptop on the Back seat, lying their with all Car gates open…….for the1uninvited snatcher…….….just waiting to be picked….…….jeez…….….I’m once again scared, even1my laptop is scared now….….! Now you know….why I told that common-sense is missing in this Car.! Fourth,1You cannot leave your Elderly people inside the Car…… in a NEXON XZ+. Yes, don’t blame TATA for1this……….you should not bring any Non-technical(or not so tech friendly people along with you in the1NEXON car)……….or teach them to immediately press the Lock/Unlock key(on Dashboard) for closing all doors1& for their own safety. Scenario:- My father/ mother both senior citizens, sitting in the car….me driving1….okay. Now, I stop for a moment to bring something from the Market enroute……they both are still sitting1within the car…….! I think I should leave them with atleast fan/blower “ON”…….or they may suffer1due to lack of ventilation / air.! So, the Ignition is kept “ON”….so the blower can work…….Now you1stepped out of the car, you just pulled your door unlock- lever…….once again all the doors are1open………….immediately teach them to press the Dashboard Key with “Lock/Unlock” Icon on1it………because even if you are carrying the Key in your pocket…….and you try to lock the Car by the1key in your hand from outside…….all the doors will remain open as the Ignition is “ON”….! What good1is the Mainkey button Lock when the Ignition is “ON” – NO Good.! Only way to close “ALL” the doors1in such a scenario….make your not so Tech-friendly old parents….learn some tech finally….…….as TATA1has once again left them totally vulnerable from outside attacks………! I hope you are getting to the main1issues, I’m trying to highlight here……….! Mileage………please don’t ask…….not atleast1me….please.….! My car has just ran 500 Kms in total run…….and the average shown in the meter for that1500 kms is 10.0……………….! Yes, the Trip meter which I never reset right from the start………is showing the1average of 10 kms for the whole life distance of 500 kms……! Forget the claims TATA motors / or ARAI did for 17 kms average……! You’re most welcome to see my Trip meter with 500kms total Car run at 10.0 kms average.! Live example for you to see. I had a word yesterday at my Dealer he simply said please don’t go with the Meter gauge…….they do not show the true picture…….!1Go for full –tank and then do the Mileage calculations. I mean okay……but didn’t he meant to say that1the Tata Fixed our NEXON vehicles with Faulty Meters….? On enquiring further he said he is a New joiner from1SKODA Motors….………and he agreed that my above mentioned points are very valid and their must be some1way to disable them through some computer setting….…….”but the actual person who can do this is not1present now”…………so maybe tomorrow he replied…….……….when the engineer will come they will1inform me…….!
Tata;Nexon20172020;22 Aug 2019;B Praveen;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Purchased XZA+ on 20/6/2019 from Ambattur, Chennai. High vibrations in 1st gear and while reversing from day 1. Weird noise after applying brake from front and back. Complained at service centre - though they are courteous they did not accept that there is a fault in the vehicle. Complained twice to CEO Concorde and Tata Motors. Car was in service centre for 7 days - clutch was defective to be rep laced along with fly wheel, for that Service center made me to take AMC Gold which I am not interested but paid to get my car out of service center. Problems still persist - but as per TATA these are normal:1.Swing motion of car like wooden horse toy(min 3 times) after applying brake.2.Weird noises after braking -various types of sounds can"t be explained.3.Engine knocking sound while AMT changes gears from 1 to 2 to 3 - even bus/truck will not have this type of sound. Inconsistent and mis fits in interior plastic -looks premium but of cheap quality plastic - any item you place in glove box, sun glass folder, water bottles in door panels will give sound / vibration.And lastly forget about mileage - in city traffic 6 to16.5(petrol).Complete package of unpleasant driving in city traffic.
Tata;Nexon20172020;19 Nov 2018;HPFC Dot;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Sharing My Yesterday (18/11/2018) Experience:- Tata Nexon Kraz Plus (Petrol) is Best Level Compact SUV till now as per my 700 Kilometer Local Drive Experience. All Doors Side Rubbers protectors came out easily on dust cleaning. Driver Side Front Pillar visibility issue and creates right side blind spot. Others no issue find in this compact SUV.Very Poor Level Tata Service Centre (Hartron Motors LL P, Sector-18, Gurugram) Washing, Air, Vacuum & Cleaning Service.Never advise to take this Washing & Cleaning service there. Best Quality Services available outside Service Stations at various locations in Gurgaon with cheaper cost within 45-60 minutes maximum.But Tata Service Centre staff don"t know the cleaning process of cars. They don"t wash, air, vacuum service properly.Dust inside cabin after Air Pressure and Tree Leaves left outside Wiper Area after wash remains in car washing, after than vacuum cleaner service also very bad and at last on remaining dust of inside the dashboard, they done the polish work for brightness increasing.Small Mud stains still remains outside the car body, which are very easily removable with wet cloth in-front of them I clean with my finger only.I don"t understand what they have done in my SUV in the name of washing & cleaning from 12:34 PM to 4:45 PM (4 Hours ++ Time Taken and All time I keep standing there and watched all their activities on other cars also.)At last I have took the gate pass, because I have to go somewhere for meeting.As per my experience totally dumb & untrained staff at washing & cleaning service.
Tata;Nexon20172020;1 Sep 2019;Ishaan Agrawal;4.0; Daily Commute ;I own an XMA petrol and have done about 1600KM now. The performance improved a bit after the first service (checkup) but it seems like the mileage has taken a further hit. I"ve been observing the a mileage of 7KM/L in city driving and I don"t rush. And this is extremely disappointing. I can"t even blame the gearbox because I drive in manual mode so I can shift when I want to. I usually shift at ab out 2K RPM. Now another problem is that since it isn"t a high capacity engine performing duty in a heavy car, the dependency on the turbocharger is high. Now to work around the turbo lag, one needs to put the foot down to get a quick move on.So, this is like a vicious circle Nexon Petrol owners have gotten caught in. I believe and desperately hope Tata fixes this issue, as this definitely will affect the owners
Tata;Nexon20172020;14 Dec 2019;Nishant Gaikwad;2.0; Daily Commute;Don't Buy TATA Nexon XMA or XZ Plus Petrol Version, I Own one & its pathetic- Things 1) Average, Even though company claims that it has 17 'ish something, In city its 7 to 9.7 km/lit only, before 1st service it was 5 km/lit can you believe...its like taking white elephant at home.. 2) AMT thing is all rubbish, its slow pick up like hell & roll back on gradient, Believe me i own this from 2 months & took car to dealership for 3 times, its performance is too sluggish, pick up is like shit. 3) Car built might be strong yet it has obstruction in vision due to thick side beam & rear you will hardly get much to see.
Tata;Nexon20172020;9 Nov 2019;Chinmai Krishna;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;A perfect family car, gives excellent safety and features. The is low end turbo lag in petrol varients but still a powerful car that can be used for any purpose. The suspension is so good and the driving is really fun. The mileage is also not bad considering the mass of the vehicle. I get around 15-18 kmpl on highways if driven properly. For me 0-100 comes at 11 seconds. This car doesn't have any problem driving through bad roads it takes them with ease. If you are a person looking for a multipurpose car this is it. This is a good family car and also can be driven for pure fun(be safe).
Tata;Nexon20172020;28 Sep 2018;Singh Rahul;4.0; Daily Commute ;Nexon is not just VFM but a great experience car. In few areas, it's difficult to even match it but my personal experience with car has not been so great ! Being a completely new car from scratch from tata stable,it has it's own share of issues. Rattling issues and random mechanical issues decreases the confidence on the car + in-experience of service staff make the issues and whole experience of owning a good car takes a hit!!!Rattling noises from plastic to mirrors, issues in basic car mechanic like gear-box problem in slotting 2/3/4 gear during driving, gear lever getting stuck on 3 gear , steering column noise, steering getting stuck on either of extreme ends, suspension rods noise etc are just few examples I've faced or facing currently.It's these experiences which eclipses the goodness of the car which are comfort of choosing different driving modes, classy interiors & exteriors, superb rear seating comfort, practical usable features etc PS: I drive daily 100+ kms to office with around 85+ kms in highway still getting not the best of results in terms of mileage
Tata;Nexon20172020;25 Sep 2019;Baskar Sport..;1.0; Occasional Commute ;Hi my name is bakar I have taken tata nexon 6 month before from KHT motor domlur .they are very good in sales till the deal completes,after no one will call even for the delivery ,i was waiting 2 hour to take the car ,That s OK .the service today 25/09/19 nobody called I called once for the service they charged me 400 Rs for pickup the car my car millage is only ( 7 KM ) regarding I spoke with the service team till now no response .please check The service and millage Before deciding This car . my mobile number is 984****471. disappointed customer
Tata;Nexon20172020;29 Oct 2020;Jai Prakash;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;This is my family's first car. Really happy with the features and styling. But company should work on the their software and infotainment system. It is not seamless, it's laggy. Features are top notch but what is the use when they does not work seamlessly and properly. Company should resolve this issue in the future updates. Riding quality is good although instant pickup is missing in every mode. It's not a sports car but engine refinement is needed so it can be fast in no time.
Tata;Nexon20172020;13 Dec 2019;Ed Sukesh;4.0; Tours ;Overall performance and comfort for long distance driving is very good. I like the way the car handles on the road and the steering is quite responsive. AMT is excellent in sports mode on highways. The %5 star Ancap rating is reassuring and the car does feel solid. The fit and finish could be better and the touch screen more responsive and bigger but these are not critical. The car has performed v ery well over some rough terrain. Sure it does not have snob value but who cares.
Tata;Nexon20172020;23 Nov 2018;Dinesh Thiya..;4.7; Family Car ;Its worth and value for money. Tata has made such a good quality solid build car. Multi driving modes is superb choice and you feel the response immediately.Front seats are so good and most important is that rear seats are having much thigh support which is helpful in long driving. Mileage as on today i got 16.5kmpl which is really good keeping the weight 1200-1300kg. I was looking for baleno ini tially but then if u spend 1L extra, its worth single penny. In globabl NCAP crash teat, it scored 4star for adult and 3star for child occupant. Headrooms could have been increased a bit more. Huge, heavy and safest car with decent mileage, good driving experience is a pleasure
Tata;Nexon20172020;23 Nov 2019;Manabendra T..;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Good experience,I am an owner of a xza+revotron nexon.it is a very good car.in high way,it gives 15 .5 to 16 km/l ,(full tank to full tank method) in eco mode . riding comfort is superb,I took it to tawang ( 13000 feet from see lavel) from guwahati after 3rd day of purchase with full load and the Tata kid completed the return journey very comfortably.
Tata;Nexon20172020;3 Dec 2019;Jo;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;stunned to see the interiors when stepped into the uber car.Great interiorsdash off centre like in s luxury segment or above it? nice steering cover great suspension smart digital console low engine noice satisfied with it till the driver doubted about Tatas service.but I was optimistic this time .thanks.
Tata;Nexon20172020;27 Dec 2018;Pranesh Upashi;4.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Overall a very good Car.-XZ+ petrol Good features : comfortable Bucket seats, 5Start NCAP rating will confirm the safety of the vehicle, Very good Suspension, Power at the cost of Millage,3 drive modes -City, Eco,Sports, Spacious Boot space, Golve box with cooler Needs Improvement : Gear change is hard, Steering is heavy, Indicator knobs needs to be softer, Eco mode power is not sufficient to over take on highways, Difficulty in latching the rear seat belts as the buckle tends move too inside .Millage after 7000km : Eco- 15-18 kmpl, City- 13-14 kmpl, Sport
Tata;Nexon20172020;30 Jan 2019;San B;4.7; Daily Commute;I bought the base model. Had taken her out on highways on two occasions.... once the average was 22 km/ltr and on second time it was 25 ...Blessing in disguise ...the car is wonderful to drive..... with minimum effort you can sail on the road..... 3 modes are fantastically made.... on sports mode it"s a beast ( through average will be low) but it can test your limits and skills.... I took it to 17 5 on arga lucknow express way....and there was no sound at all.... control is excellent but need to work on braking... Overall nice experience in 8 lakhs....
Tata;Nexon20172020;3 Sep 2019;Saravanan Su..;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I bought Nexon XZA+ Petrol variant 20 days back. So far driven around 435 KMs. Yet to go for any long drive. Only drove in Bangalore city traffic. I am worrying more about the mileage consumption. In the odometer, it shows only 8 KM. Will it improve post 1st service. Any honest feedback?
Tata;Nexon20172020;20 Apr 2019;Aarsh Gawande;2.3; Daily Commute ;Only 2* because of their service. This car deserve 5*, Tata has made a superb car a perfect machine. So far drove 2000km no issue,awesome vehicle. I love it. Concorde motors will ruin Tata brand. Unprofessional managers and staff, full of liars. Even after 2 months they didn"t provide accessories. Denied 2 year extended warranty which was committed. They don"t bother whether your car is washed or not at the time of delivery. Guys never go there if you want to buy nexon find some good dealers in your area.
Tata;Nexon20172020;30 Sep 2020;Amith Nataraj;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Really good family car especially performance, comfort at the back. Really good handling, and takes bumps really really well. No issues whatsoever till now from Jan 2019. Only con which I feel is A-pillar during curves and for a petrol engine, noise is quite vocal.
Tata;Nexon20172020;5 Dec 2019;Vedanshu Sac..;4.0; Daily Commute ;Few features are lacking out which should be mandatory.1 - Automatic lock when car moves 2- Boot can only be opened from inside of the car. i.e. if you just have to open boot, first you have to enter the car, press button, then only you can access boot.
Tata;Nexon20172020;8 Aug 2018;Biswaroop Deb;2.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I would like to give a feedback on my recent purchase of TATA Nexon in Kolkata.I got the delivery in the month of February . Till now around 4700 KM I have driven in the city. But I found the mileage of the car is extremely poor.It is about 7.26kmpl. I had visited the workshop . They then drove the car is a semi ideal condition and found the mileage around 16kmpl.I had specifically told them the city mileage is extremely poor. They could do nothing.
Tata;Nexon20172020;1 Jan 2020;Tanishk Raj;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;The best part of what I like about my car is its build quality and of course its crunchy style as the modern SUV's need instead of a boxy like appearence or a lame suv with a lame wheel at its rear boot lid......
Tata;Nexon20172020;27 Dec 2019;Jignesh Tekale;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Wonderful Experience & Amazed with the performance and styling, comfort level, looks, safety. infact everything is great except average. its good but needs to be little bit high near to 18-20 kmpl.

Tata;Nexon20172020;6 Jun 2019;Rajan Gupta;4.0; Daily Commute ;It is very nice and smooth in running SUV.I enjoy driving on this AMT car. The local city mileage is very low it gives 11 and 13 on highway. I did on it its first service so far. I think mileage may improve after 3 services as told by the company , lets hope for the best. Its breaking system is very poor. On hills it is not very successful.

Tata;Nexon20172020;8 Oct 2020;Suman Kumar;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;Hi, I'm sharing my review after completing an year of ownership and a good 23000 Kms on various terrains. It's a complete made in India and value for money product with leading benefits of : Road presence, strong armour, fuel economy (if you drive with optimum revz), stable on all terrains (I tried on highways, hills, careful off-roads and what else!), cabin space - specially the thigh support for long journeys, confident braking effects, good steering controls, optimum maintenance cost and safety.Scope for improvement : 1. NVH is higher as compared to it's competitors2. Useable roof rail could've helped more (for carrying your trekking equipment atleast)3. Foldable rear tray would add ease of access from inside
Tata;Nexon20172020;4 Oct 2020;Abhishek Singh;4.7; Daily Commute ;I bought this car by comparing its features against price. Safety was my second concern and compact suv was the third point which Nexon tick right. Driving in city as well as highway is very stable and there is no trouble in comfort even in bumper to bumper traffic. Seating position is higher which gives feel of domination in traffic where most of the hatchbacks are plying usually. Fuel economy is little concern with around 9-10kmpl on petrol but it’s justified when it’s churning so much power which is higher than breeza. Shock absorbers are well fitted and jerking is less and smooth drive. Car feels spacious and boot size is bigger than breeza and other competitor. There is brand assurance of Indian company Tata and service centre has better reach and services. Parts are not costly. Built is very robust and iron sheet used is so strong than little hatchbacks won’t be able to create dent in traffic if collide at low speed. Overall very good balance of price, features, safety, technology and aspiration of an Indian customer.
