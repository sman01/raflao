MarutiSuzuki;Eeco;18 Jan 2020;Jay Rajput;4.0; Family Car ;I have bought Eeco van and it's best VAN for the middle class family. apart from that I also like the 1.2 liter engine it's gives you batter driveablelity the city as well on the highway you can't feel any lag in the engine when it's come to mileage this VAN will gives you mileage 14 KMPL with AC and 16 KMPL with out AC depanding on your driving style. And Eeco gets soft suspension setup which are really nice if car is loaded and if you driving on the bad road but if you driving alone then ride quality get little bit bounce.
MarutiSuzuki;Eeco;1 Oct 2020;Rajan V;2.7; Family Car ;Performance of AC is very low. Dealers informed that being van type customer should not expect more like car. Also, whenever there is a break down. Road side assistance is very very poor. First they ask distance from their show room and immediately compel to bring the vehicle through toe vehicle and the charge would be Minimum Rs.2000/-. If we go and repair by engaging local mechanic the expense w ould be around 300 to 400 rupees ony. Whatever we say, they tell same like repetition and not at all hear our problems.

MarutiSuzuki;Eeco;3 Nov 2019;Kartick Bane..;2.3; Daily Commute ;This car have enough space to carry any goods. To the back side. Which are normally not present in others car. And also this car side door without any space you can open it. But side door are not so eazily to open or close. Every time open r close the door have some powerful hands required.

MarutiSuzuki;Eeco;7 Mar 2019;Tharamel Tha..;4.7; Daily Commute ;5 seater ac cng so is underpowered when ac is on full blast in peak of summer and guzzles petrol and gas ,so mileage falls to 10 per litre of petrol and 15 per kg of gas and as volume of vehicle is large ac appears ineffectived in summer ,another impt draw back is lack of power steering which was present on the versa ,so all in all vfm and defenitely a better upgrade from omni lpg which was my fir st vehicle
