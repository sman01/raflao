Porsche;Cayenne;23 Nov 2019;Jo;4.3; Family Car | Occasional Commute | Tours ;Can stretch the budget for a cayenne as xc90 and Amgs are becoming costly.Petrol only ..stopped diesel for good.Fast yet silent.Be ready to spend more for more features.New 2019 styling and rear is worth the price. Be thorough with the cars specs, book an appointment,buy a blazer suit (if you don't have one).Borrow an expensive shining shoes .Sun glasses. Boast about your assets.Dont forget to dri nk water as you have to spend hours with the small bottle they give and wait for the sales consultant to come.
