Hyundai;Creta20152020;6 Apr 2019;Rajiv Ranjan;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;I have purchased Creta Petrol Executive in Mar-19. When you will go through the creta catalog, you will see a lot of attractive features,but will you get those features ..no absolutely not. Hyundai has launched many variant of creta...each have some stand apart features but no version have got all those features. I have purchased petrol top model but it misses on many features such as, Cons of thi s top model: 1. No voice command- You cannot call anyone through voice command. You need to stop your vehicle to call someone from your contact list. You can only call recent dialed number through pressing a botton on steering twice . This is a big feature miss. No Hyundai have this features which is a common in s cross, Ford eco etc.2. No Auto link- Creta catalog have a dedicated page for auto link which will help monitor your vehicle health and driving pattern. But this is limited to Dual tone varient only. Creta Executive doesn"t have this feature. A big miss again.3. No child seat anchor points: This model doesn"t have this. Only automatic transmission features child seat mount. Again a big miss for creat ex.4. No 60:40 split seat: If your child wants to play inside car then this one is a great features. Even in case of three person and big luggage this feature helps. This is missing in Creta Executive.5. No Remote boot opener- it is not there though featured in it"s catalog.6. No voice recognition for GPS : A big miss again. You need connect to Android auto for voice recognition . This doesn"t work. System will always tell you " I couldn"t understand but I can learn". Disappointing.7. Low powered petrol version: don"t go by engine size . 1.6 litre petrol is fuel hungry but powerless specially when you climb an incline.8. No light in vanity mirror: My wife always tells me why it is not there when other low budget cars have this.9. No Auto retract rear view mirror: Rear view mirror doesn"t get retracted upon locking the vehicle this makes the ORVM damage prone. This feature is prevent in other cars like i20.10. Useless Mirror link: This is a feature for making Creta catalog attractive but this is useless. This comes on outdated phones which no one carry. Upon insisting, Hyundai sent a outdated phone model of 2017 which supports mirror link.11. No Tyre pressure monitoring system: This is a good safety feature specially for them who fail to recognize if their Tyre has low or no air. This can prevent a lot of accident upon Tyre air leak. Missing features in Creta.12. No 4 wheel drive: Though this is also not common in other cars.13. Hill hold not of any use: This feature is not of any use as I have experienced. I often run in hilly roads.It gives around 1 second hold when you leave brake at incline to press accelerator but I couldn"t able to use it.14. Need foot step to go inside car: For children and short height family members specially ladies. Foot step need to be fitted by dealer at extra cost and it is prone to get rubbed in walls due to projected portion. 15. Hard dashboard: it doesn"t have soft touch dashboard.Pros of this model:1. Sunroof : Entertaining for children if there is any among your family. 2. Ventilated seat: It can give a little bit of comfort during your long drive. Comes at a price of your home AC. 3. Rear View camera: Helps you park confidently.4. Premium leather seat: Looks and feel premium.5. Six air bags: It is fitted with.6. ESP: It has Electron stability program which might be working during sudden steer but not experienced so far.7. Good sound system: It features an arkamys sound system enabling you localized sound inside cabin.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;23 Nov 2019;Umesh Shejao;4.3; Daily Commute ;Hyundai Creta sx Auto The name it self's convey the msg that you r in premium segment car.I own my first new car in d year 2016 Oct .But before that let me tell you that I had own maruti zen then maruti wagonr and after words. Chevrolet captivata all are very good and family Car .But when I purchase My Beast Creta Must tell you that it's one of the finest model from Hyundai Family. It's give you a pleasure of Richness, comfort of driving SUV , family car, and must say a premium high profile car segment.I usually drive car 90 %in city driving and that too in Mumbai heavy traffic from Borivali to Andheri All 365 days full jam.But thank God I bought CRTEA and that too automatic.Otherwise it's horrible experience of driving manuals car in full traffic jam.Well talking about Milage I would say in city driving the Beast is giving me 15/16 kmpl And on highway I will be 20 /22 And that too non stop driving.AC cooling is superb in 5 min entire cabin is cool.One thing I would like to share with every one that the maintenance cost is too high.Seriously guys whenever I send my car for servicing the minimum bill amount is 18000 And not below that.I mean it seriously.I have all bill from hyundai sai service center. I don't understand why Hyundai is not taking action on this kind of Loot from service center. I want hyundai to grow in Aisa market then they should think on that other wise they will also become like Chevrolet car .No one going to buy in future.But apart from maintenance cost the car is SUPERB.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;18 Feb 2020;AKMDD Ken;4.0; Occasional Commute;2020 Hyundai Creta will receive the new bumpers, different grille upfront, and slight changes in the interior. The SUV is based on second-gen ix25, which was revealed in China in the previous year. The company has said that the SUV comes with a futuristic and muscular design, improving its road presence. The side profile of the SUV looks quite right, it has 17 inches alloy wheels and bold side cre ases. The details about the interior of 2020 Hyundai Creta is yet to be revealed, and we can also expect some minor changes in the interior. The SUV offers new LED tail-lamps and a revised bumper. Installation of the dual exhaust is also expected. The SUV will share its transmission and engine with the KIA Seltos. The sale of the car will be comm3enced in later in this year in the month of March.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;11 May 2019;Aneesh Varghese;2.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;The clutch is so hard that my entire leg is paining. Driving on the crowded Bengaluru roads is a nightmare, especially with half clutch presses. I am afraid that my inguinal hernia would reappear due to the constant thrust that I"ve to exert with my left leg. The car requires frequent down shifts in the city traffic. I would have expected the creta to be fine in 3rd gear for the speed range of 20 - 40 kmph. At 25kmph, if you try to accelerate in 3rd gear, the response is so poor that even auto drivers would start honking from behind. You have to down shift to 2nd and immediately upshift to 3rd within a few seconds. Imagine doing this every now and then with a hard clutch. This is a bigger problem in highways. You are behind a bus waiting to overtake it at say 30kmph. For sudden acceleration you have to downshift to 2nd and immediately upshift your 3rd - all required before even you complete the overtaking.On ghat roads, it is between 2nd and 1st gears. I saw many cars going better than mine in those roads.Mileage in city varies from 7.5 to 10.5. In the highways you get around 15 to 17.The pros: ventilated seats, sunroof (let"s hot air escape fast), leather seats, spacious interiors, beautiful exteriors
Hyundai;Creta20152020;23 May 2020;Ravi Kumaar;4.7; Daily Commute ;It's comfortable for city & highway, leg room is adequate both front and back for six footer like me. Mileage is far than expected on NH and pretty decent in city around 14-15kmpltr. However predominantly clutch plate problem inbetween 25k to 30k...is quite bothering. On the whole iam satisfied and pat my back for choosing Creta .....
Hyundai;Creta20152020;11 Apr 2019;Manjunatha H..;2.7; Occasional Commute ;I own Hyundai Creta 2016 model. In past 3 years twice I noticed that, while vehicle is in move the steering wheel gets locked" and1it is a life threatening issue either to you or to 3rd party. Because in middle of the road, you couldn't use1your steering to turn until you switch off the engine and on it again. Hyundai service center couldn't provide assurance for permanent fix for this life threat ening problem. Looks low quality motor sensor in steering wheel. Beware of this problem while you drive/while you buy this low standard vehicle.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;20 Nov 2020;CIZER THAPA;3.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Mileage is not that good as i have installed both bumper guards.Maintenance is ok kind with normal servicing but parts aren't cheap.Safety is offered, We can feel it in the cabin.Being base variant there is lack of safety features.Comfort is decent, There is road noise coming to cabin.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;29 May 2019;Bonzar Brahma;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;love the easy soft handling, can turn and maneuver. The car easily in daily day to day use without any strain. Seating comfort could be better, its good but could be better. rear occupant space is good, although never got to seat there myself. 20000 kms in driver's seat in 1 and half years and still loving it. service is a little expensive and sometimes not upto mark, but could be just the service center i am visiting
Hyundai;Creta20152020;11 Mar 2020;Waheed Pasha;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;overall car is good but the maintanence cost is too high and give car servicing into service center they give you a high bill and every time I give my car into service center there is a problem in it after the delivery

Hyundai;Creta20152020;1 May 2019;Prabhu Patel;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;More than satisfied with the vehicle. Makes a great daily commuter which doubles up as the occasional tourer. We have the top spec petrol version SX+. Chose the 1.6 petrol version as our daily mileage is limited or so we thought. Diesel offers better mileage as well as is zipper to drive IMHO. Tradeoff is the extra bucks for the diesel version.
Hyundai;Creta20152020;26 Aug 2020;Khunlem Konyak;4.3; Family Car ;It is a very comfortable car, with good engine performance, safety, overall a very good car, I really like the way the petrol engine sounds but maintenance wise it is quite expensive
