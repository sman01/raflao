Honda;City;31 Dec 2020;Easwaramurth..;1.0; Daily Commute ;My honda city car- tn43k 5445- suddenly stopped on 28-12-2020 and never started again.Road side assistance was called for and vehicle was towed to nearby honda service centre ‚Äúmysore inspiron honda‚Äù.After a day i was informed the fuel pump has to be replaced.I never expected a reputed company like honda to deliver a car with defective fuel pump.Adding fuel to the fire i was told to wait for at least 10 to 12 days for replacement.Now my question is what arrangements honda is to make for my conveyance.Does honda provide me a spare car or does it bear the cost.Even if you rectify the car what guarantee is there that it will not happen again? honda very well knew this persisting problem with city and amaze but my vehicle was not called for rectification.I never saw any other branded car stopped in the middle of the road during this era.Shame on honda.Expecting a good reply from honda.Other wise i will have to look for other options.

Honda;City;12 Dec 2020;Anish Morey;5.0; Daily Commute ;I am using the 2014 top end diesel manual variant of the honda city and i am Very happy with the car except for a couple of issues. The front bonnet alignment of honda city is very poor and the bumper always tends to come out of its clips. I have noticed this in a lot of honda city cars on road and the company just changes the bushings but that too stays for a couple of weeks or so. I think honda really needs to have a look on this point.Secondly my car has a leakage issue since a very long time from the doors during heavy monsoon seasons or when i take my car for a wash at the washing centers, and the company has not been able to solve it at all even after keeping the car for a couple of weeks for inspection. And the height is, my cars inside flooring is filled with water from the overnight rains for almost 4 -5 times. So i have found a solution for it myself. Otherwise the engine is very smooth and the car has no other technical issues. I have been using it for over 6 years now and still there is no sound from the interior plastics too. I manage to get a good average of about 22 - 23.There is no car in this segment that gives as much leg room as this car considering my height is 6'3" and i sit very comfortably in both, the front as well as the rear seat. The rear seat comfort is great even for long drives but in the front seat, i do face back ache during long drives.Overall i am very happy with the purchase and would recommend going in for the same model.
Honda;City;25 Sep 2020;Mahesh Bibave;4.3; Daily Commute;Very nice car at all but ground clearance is very low I replaced tyres of 195/65R15 to increase it's ground clearance. Road holding and control becomes very good. I increased front height upto 10 mm now with 5 passengers in car doesn't scrapes on speed breakers.Very nice car
