Hyundai;Xcent;7 Dec 2019;Sachin Hiwase;4.7; Family Car ;I use the car as a family car. Run in villages and small contry roads. Very good comfort and good handling. I have covered 900 km on stretch with fully loaded car. Still very good comfort. You get little tired after 400 km in driving seat. Otherwise very happy. Got an average of 17.5 per km when I take trip from nagpur to vaishnodevi via delhi gurgaon and that too in hot scorching summer with full ac on and speed always above 100 kmphr. I am happy.
