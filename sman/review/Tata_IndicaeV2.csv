Tata;IndicaeV2;10 May 2020;M S;1.0; Occasional Commute;Worst car among all others Whenever I go by uber or ola if they send indica it is always found very difficult. No sufficient space and comfort.If I need to go to any trips I never prefer this car.This is like an old ambassador, to say in one word it is like going in 1947 old car.
