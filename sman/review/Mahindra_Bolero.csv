Mahindra;Bolero;16 Apr 2020;Abhinav bhagat;3.7; Daily Commute | Tours;Bolero is a true SUV in every sense. can accommodate more than 7 people, is big & have a lot of space. Works brilliantly on almost every terrain.Ride quality is good, build quality is good. Easy to maintain, although mileage is on the lower side but for a SUV like bolero this could be neglected. Mahindra could yet work on its interior looks & making a bit more comfortable an amazing car in its seg ment.
Mahindra;Bolero;10 Sep 2020;Rajat Bijur;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours ;Contrary to what I heard, its a great car to own for out of town visits especially rural areas with bad roads. The seating position and stock headlamps are quite good even for night driving. Its turning radius is a little big but given its usage it is acceptable. From point of view of comfort, I have yet to drive a real long trip yet but the sub 100 kms have been a breeze.
Mahindra;Bolero;10 Nov 2020;Himanshu Upa..;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Best budget SUV once I have driven it. It was the best experience but bs4 is best bs6 looks is not much nice if u want the best budget SUV at 7 to 10 lakhs so go for bolero it is the nice best performance.

Mahindra;Bolero;21 Nov 2020;St Antonys;4.7; Family Car ;Good.A best vehicle without airbags in full strength and confidence.Only the problem is the blind charges levied by the mahindra care or authorised service stations are too expensive and not justifyable.
