MarutiSuzuki;Ritz;10 Mar 2020;JAY JANGID;4.3; Family Car ;Ritz was a best performance hatchback ... whenever you push hard you will definitely feel the punch of engine ....it is more stable than swift on 140-160 kmph on it's stock tyres ....it giving 20-21 kmpl mileage on the average speed like 90-100kmph but above 100 kmph it will give 16-18 kmpl ...but that's also good mileage. it having nice handling & steering feedback. ritz haven't good ride ..becau se it's suspension is tunning for stiff ride but that helps in the stability on high speed. i love this car ...the one con of my ritz is.. it doesn't having dual airbags and abs.
MarutiSuzuki;Ritz;13 Dec 2020;Veeresh Netekal;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Car is in super condition, purchased in 2011 (Nov). Single use from the date of purchase. Car looks and accessories are good. Regular service in showroom only. Recently spent 40 K and replaced most accessories and necessary vehicle parts. Comfortable in city and also long drive, Mileage of 18-22 kms based on the road and journey.. I am selling this car because I received Bolero from company. I can assure purchaser will definitely like and enjoy car driving.
MarutiSuzuki;Ritz;23 Nov 2020;Madhu Rao;3.3; Family Car ;Driving comfort is excellent.Suitable for a family of 4.Overall good pick up.Engine responsive as you hit 2000+ rpm in second gear.Reversing can be a nightmare in tight situations since rear view for the driver is a challenge.Sometimes the reverse gear is hard to engage not sure if this is specific to my car.Turning radius is low and very good ground clearance of 170mm.

MarutiSuzuki;Ritz;23 May 2020;Sonu Monnappa;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;10 years with the car . Its is like a family member . Still gives 16kmpl on highway and 14kmpl in city . Fun to drive , comfortable hatchback . Total value for money . Maintenance cost is good but the service stations do shabby work sometimes . But the car still proves to be more reliable than new age Marutis.
MarutiSuzuki;Ritz;8 Mar 2020;Vinod Netha;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Ritz is a powerful but compact size car with easy maneuverability. I love its performance from 2000 RPM which resembles like a mini sports car. But its little laggy below 2000 RPM. I haven't checked its mileage by tank full method but from MID it show an average of 17-18 kmpl in mixed conditions drive.

Handling is excellent, even on the highway, steer ing is nimble, acceleration is quick.
