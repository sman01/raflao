MarutiSuzuki;AStar;6 Aug 2018;Anubhav Gupta;3.3; Daily Commute ;When you start the car it is normal for 1000 - 1200 CC cars, next clutch ohhh it is uncomfortable means you have to apply power from your foot to press the clutch and believe me it is hard. Next pickup is impressive, steering wheel again little hard. Rest everything is fine.
