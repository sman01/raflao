Renault;Pulse;5 Mar 2020;Kapil K;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am driving Renault pulse from past 5 years. As the technology is allied together with Nissan Micra model. Both are identical in many ways.Pulse really justifies 1.2 litre petrol engine with power pulse. body engine ratio is really balanced showing great performance in city and highway.once i had long drive for around 300km with one short tea break without tiring my backbone. Petrol engine mileag e touched 19.5 once in highway long driving without AC. No doubt that one can achieve good mileage with some driving tips.Low ground clearance has good grip on roads but also annoying when facing pits.ABS is a missing and only negative point i feel considering its a good city car.

Renault should think to relaunch with facelift with same powerfull DCi engine,
Renault;Pulse;17 Sep 2020;Ishan Verman;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;The service cost is quite high due to which overall maintenance cost is more than its peers. In driving the car is great with good acceleration and speed. Very easy to overtake on highways. Has good ground clearance too.
