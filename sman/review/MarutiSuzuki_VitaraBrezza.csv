MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;5 Apr 2020;Sankarkrishn..;2.0; Family Car;I was waiting for months to buy the petrol version. But now I am disappointed. There is nothing new in the updated brezza. Still missing below features.1) Tyre pressure monitor system2) Hill start assist ( only in AT)3) Electronic stability control ( only in AT)4) Rear A/c vents.5) Sunroof.Manual variant has nothing. In addition to this Maruti is not giving their Smart Hybrid system to manual vers ion. That means no idle start stop system. Now why this car?? Sad to say this but Maruti didn't utilised the opportunity to improve. Vitara brezza lost its Unique value.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;11 Oct 2020;Venu N;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;My car crossed 3000 mark already. Its pick up is satisfactory though not the best. For daily commuters like me who drive car maximum 130 kmph , it s ok. I am getting 15 to 15.5 kmpl on highways , 13.5 on local roads . In off-road trips i got as less as 11.3 kmpl. Spec and price is very good for a car like this. After sales service is excellent. the service station guys respond to our quiries even at 8 pm !
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;25 Feb 2020;Sreenivasa Rao;2.3; Daily Commute ;Kitna dethi hai people, this is correct vehicle. Comfort nil. Serious blind spots on sides due to improper placing of ORVMs. Front seats horrible. Need additional ortho seat attachments. Poor quality painting. Safety I am not sure, will it sustain any crash. Maintenance cost is average. But poor handling by Maruti service centres. Service executives dos not know how to behave with the customers.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;29 Mar 2020;Jabir Kasim;2.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car;Compare to other cars like venue, creta and seltos. Less features and styling. Especially interior quality and style very bad. Interior style very old like 2012maruthi swift. Eg. Stearing... No rear ac. No head rest in rear seat in base model. In my opinion they should consider this as basic things of car when customs they spend more than 8lakh.now in market a lot other options available.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;1 Sep 2020;Cashew2902;4.0; Daily Commute ;Its a good overall package. Good drive experience. Decent mileage in petrol as well, so pretty fuel efficient i must say. Drive performance is better than Nexon and Ecosport since this is a 4 cylinder engine and the others have a 3 cylinder engine. Thats why bought it.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;9 Aug 2020;Karthik Sinha;2.0; Daily Commute ;Recently switched from swift zdi to brezza zxi+, downside is: it lack power and in elevated terrain you will feel the lag; the interior plastic is very cheap and fragile, you can easily feel it on the dashboard and the indicator switches.
MarutiSuzuki;VitaraBrezza;19 Jul 2020;Duyu Tagio;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Performance wise it's good, mileage best, just need to improve it's comfort. Stiff suspension and body noise. Despite of good ground clearance claim by company very often hits towing towing hook and few other front body parts.
