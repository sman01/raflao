Tata;Hexa20172020;17 Jan 2021;Shah Husain;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;Riding this car is a pleasure.The presence it has on road is class apart.It sticks to the ground and revs up so quickly despite its enormous weight.Best thing about this car is its suspensions.The quality of ride is amazing and you won't feel any bumps.The off-road capabilities are also good.Mate it with a k&n filter and performance spark plugs and you are ready to fly.Service cost is a bit high a nd mileage in city is around 10-11.Pros- great ride qualitygreat visibility aroundgood road presence punchy powerfeels safespacious giantcons-no touch infotainment service cost is high weight.
Tata;Hexa20172020;6 Aug 2019;Kunal Patekar;4.7; Family Car ;I have always been a tata hexa fan since the car was launched. finally i purchased car in 2018. styling features safety everything about the car is perfect except the issues that i have gone through after purchasing the car. Hexa has problem of Engine head leakage s my brand new cars engine was opened before completing a year and even the engine belt is making noise. i feel really sad that my new car engine was opened even if they have fixed it completely still i will suggest if you want to go for 7 seater or 6 seater then go for INNOVA if your budget is around 18-19 lakh.

Tata;Hexa20172020;10 Nov 2020;Bharath Sai;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Excellent car. Good features. Gives good feel while driving. Should be first option if you are going to buy 7 seater under 22lakhs. No issues so far and running smooth. Comfortable, i drove around 400km without any stop.
Tata;Hexa20172020;11 Aug 2020;Sarfaraz San..;5.0; Family Car ;i love this car in this price range. it has all you need. Expecting high mileage from a 7 seater suv is out of context hence i think the car is extremely well designed. But i wish its initial acceleration was a bit more.
