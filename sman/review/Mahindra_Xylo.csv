Mahindra;Xylo;13 Jul 2020;Dr Indranil;5.0; Tours ;I HAVE BEEN USING THE MAHINDRA XYLO FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS AND HAVE DRIVEN TO MANY PARTS OF INDIA AND NEPAL....IT IS A MARVELLOUS CAR AND IT HAS BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF MY FAMILY AND A BIG SHARE HOLDER OF THE MANY WONDERFUL TRIPPING MEMORIES THAT I HAVE TILL DATE.
Mahindra;Xylo;14 Aug 2020;Vibhu Puri;4.3; Family Car ;It is a nice family car offering good amount of power , accomodates 7 no. of people . Even the last row can accommodate 3 adults. Offers good amount of comfort also provides plenty of leg room in all the three rows.

Mahindra;Xylo;3 Mar 2019;Rajesh Vijay..;4.3; Occasional Commute ;It's not a Xylo, it's a Genius. Xylo engine's a pickup we use for the cement transport. It's a very comfortable vehicle. And we are very happy. The service charge is a bit high. And the service in Goa is not do quick. So we do face the problem. But it is ok they do a good job. So overall it is fine..
Mahindra;Xylo;31 Dec 2018;Nishant B;3.7; Family Car ;Xylo is Big MUV and has space for 7 with ease, even the last row seat is very comfortable and spacious compared to other cars in the segment, we often go in this car with full family and every time we enjoy traveling in it, its a good car for big families.
