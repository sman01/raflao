Volkswagen;PoloGTI;13 Jan 2021;ASIA PACIFIC;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours | Family Car ;Great performance, But high maintenance cost.Poor service backup and support.Ground clearance is one major issue arises for off road journey.Co.Could give more features like full touch screen android player including navigation.Screen mirror gets deactivated during driving.Overall features are less than the competitors.
