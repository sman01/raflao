Nissan;Terrano;30 Jul 2020;Siva Ganesan;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Comfortable to travel with family. You can't race. Gets you average mileage of min 15 kmpl if you drive at 80 kmph.Stable, well balanced. In about 4 years with 45 k - Total cost on service incurred around Rs.50000/-. Some of the flaws in the lining could not be repaired by the service centre.Rear view mirror rattling and sliding down (esp if it is camera mirror) is perennial from day oe and cannot be fixed by the service centre.Difficult to drive in Highway when there is trace of water on the roads during rain. Water splashes on the wind shield and chokes your visibility.Head lights - not bright. - diffculty in driving during night in small roads
Nissan;Terrano;5 Sep 2020;Dr;3.7; Daily Commute ;7th year with this car. Pros- look, comfort, good performance.Power & performance will be almost near same as initial.Cons- Mileage has drastically decreased from 19 to 12.5 with 1,70,000/- KMS.Mentainance cost is too high. Poor resale value.Up gradation for the new cars is not satisfied in attracting new customers.
Nissan;Terrano;11 Oct 2020;Debjit Chowd..;3.3; Daily Commute ;Its a high maintenance & service cost car with good mileage if you have a diesel version & commute 50km+ in a day. Good Space , High Power , Low on Key features but compensate on safety satndards. Good for long drives on tough roads.
