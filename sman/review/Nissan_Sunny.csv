Nissan;Sunny;14 Nov 2018;Hanshad Damo..;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Have been driving this Car for last four years. Started with avg mileage of 18 to 20 kmpl. But now after long drives of 150 to 400 km at a stretch and crossing 38000 km, this beauty has started giving 29 kmpl over highways and 23kmpl through city and highways and 16 to 18 kmpl in traffic choking cities.Has enough boot space to accommodate luggage for 3 members for any long trip,including stroller. . Rear seat leg space is big to hold additional luggage in upright position.. When it comes to overtake, just shift to 3rd gear and accelerate.. Feel the punch. Never seen this on honda brv or ciaz(cars I had driven on long trips).I just love it!!! At high speeds, steering gets bit tight giving you extra confidence. Also never felt that I drive a big sedan (in length). Its just driving like a Hyundai eon :). A great car to have.. Just test drive and look for safety features offered in budget price, if you plan to buy one. Only issue is with the dashboard near the steering making rattling sound. Got it corrected on last service but after a month, its back. Thanks to Kerala roads. If you have music playing loud, it shouldn"t matter though.Brakes could have been better like the one in honda brv. Overall a car that gives you adequate power, best mileage, better comfort (though body roll is there on hair pin curves) with safety not at all compromised....
Nissan;Sunny;23 Aug 2020;RAM LAKHAN;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Its a very much comfortable and love to drive car. It has a boot space of 450 liter. Leg space between the back row and front row is too much. Full comfort on long drives. Rear vents are good too. Engine of Nissan is so good that I cant describe it in my words. Its makes your more safe when you drive it on highway and do overtakes. If anyone love sedans then its my prefereable one.
