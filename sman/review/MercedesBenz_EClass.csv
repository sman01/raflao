MercedesBenz;EClass;9 Jul 2020;Misal Anand;4.0; Family Car | Occasional Commute ;The car has a good road presence as it is long and wide. It is surprisingly easy to maneuver around bends and make tight U-Turns. The suspension absorbs all bad patches and makes the ride great. One can drive this car all day across the country and not feel tired.The engine has more than enough performance and versatility. In comfort mode, one can enjoy a smooth ride and in sports mode, the car ho lds gears longer and the whole experience becomes sporty.Since there are a lot of Electronics, the maintenance cost can run high if the car is not maintained or put in use. Buy it and use it is the funda here. The car is to be enjoyed and not kept as a showpiece in the garage
MercedesBenz;EClass;2 Sep 2020;Aatish hari;5.0; Family Car ;awesome luxury. Even performance is great. Mileage is adequate. Thanks to that V6 engine. I like that entertaintment package at the rear. The E 350d has crazy amount of luxury and spacioius. I would say it is a spacious Mid-Size sedan.
MercedesBenz;EClass;12 Nov 2019;Abhinav Shankar;4.7; Family Car ;Great ride. Fabulous engine. A smooth sail to get from point to point. Does very well on different contours of land as well as varying terrains, both dry and wet, equally well. Highly recommend the 2013 Mercedes E220 CDI.
MercedesBenz;EClass;25 Dec 2018;4K Squad;4.0; Occasional Commute ;Overall a very good car,has all sorts of features that will make this car the idea car for long rides.The transmission is nice but there can be lag between the first and the second gear.The tyres are small in diameter as per me for this long and huge car.The maintenance cost can be very high for people like me.
