Mitsubishi;PajeroSport;3 Sep 2019;AMRISH CHOPRA;4.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;I have this car for more than 6 years now. I have driven this car single-handed from Kanya Kumari to Leh and beyond, and Jaiselmer & Dwarka to Mynmar border and enjoyed it. Never faced any problem, not even a puncture. Handling is beautiful even in worst of the terrains, like road to Zanskar and even Kishtwar Tandi dangerous road. Its steering and grip is beautiful even at very high speeds.
Mitsubishi;PajeroSport;25 Jul 2020;Brig Davinder;4.3; Family Car | Occasional Commute | Tours ;Very comfortable driving experience. Long journeys without fatigue. Plenty of space to carry all essential belongings. Excellent Safety features incorporated especially for children. Variable seating options available. Excellent roadside service on call.
Mitsubishi;PajeroSport;20 Jul 2020;Sumeer Sharma;4.0; Family Car | Tours ;Built like a battle tank, it simply smothers rough roads and is at its happiest when there are no roads at all. Superbly built and highly capable vehicle but badly marketed. Lacks service support.
Mitsubishi;PajeroSport;3 Sep 2020;Abhishek Parmar;3.3; Family Car | Tours ;Superb SUV. The beast. Buy the features n interiors could be improved...The tyre size should also be bigger, maybe 19 or 20 inches.The infotainment system is sweet fuckall.Regards.
