Jaguar;XE20162019;31 Dec 2019;Jo;5.0; Family Car | Occasional Commute | Tours ;2019 belongs easily to an xe petrol ( we get a petrol..some countries a diesel engine too)..this may be small comparing other Jaguars sedan . But styling makes it stand apart. When you enter and close the door only to see the door panels merge beautifully with the curved of dashboard.good interiors ..nice colour trims..seats...good exterior styling.drive typical of jaguar's..makes it worth buying more than anything in the showroom..

Jaguar;XE20162019;11 Jul 2019;Revant Valla..;5.0; Family Car;It is the best family car ever but I did not like it because it is a sports car I think Jaguar XJ is better
