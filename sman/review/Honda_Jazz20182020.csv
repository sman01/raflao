Honda;Jazz20182020;22 Jun 2020;Krishna Tiru..;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car;The current Jazz offered in both petrol and diesel variants is very pricey compared to its rivals. The only value plus points of Jazz are well refined 1.2 L petrol engine(+), CVT(++) and cabin/ boot space(+++). The attractive feature is rear tail LED lamps. The body built of the Jazz is sturdy and seems a real metal. All other specifications and features of Jazz fall far behind the competition. Ev en top variants do not get: R16 tyres, Auto head lamps, Rain sensing wipers, Rear head rests, Rear AC, DRLs, LED-projector head lamps, Cooled glove box, Rear arm rest and IVRS auto dimming that are offered on Altroz, i20, Baleno, Kwid, Micra etc.The main dis-advantages of Jazz are: too many blind spots, expensive service costs (with horrible 6 month interval), touch AC- not easy to set while driving, dual horn may not be reachable to small palms (so you have to remove one hand from steering to use the horn), spare tyre is R14 steel and front arm rest which is positioned too low to use. In some areas, after sales-service is also not professional. There are some other features in the top variants which are of rear use on Indian roads like cruise control and paddle shifts (that gives a sporty feeling though).Of course Honda dedicated years on cosmetic changes like addition of DRLs, LED projectors (this year), push start, rear LED tail lamps, Digipad 2.0, capacitive touch door handles (Last year) etc.6 x bottle holders are standard across all the variants of JAZZ (petrol and Diesel). No worries.For a solid built hatchback with best in market auto-transmission(CVT), with refined engine and lots of space inside cabin and as well boot space I suggest you go for Jazz. If you are looking for a manual transmission car.....m m m m m.
Honda;Jazz20182020;8 Jul 2019;Prodeep Ghosh;2.7; Occasional Commute ;I have the automatic and it's for my daughter. It's a well engineered petrol vehicle, the automatic is fine but not peppy enough. If you are looking to overtake at high double digits on a highway, you really have to rev it up. What's disappointing is the lack of nice features that are engineered in but not made functional. It has a provision for keyless but not enabled. Of the two sets of keys - o ne has remote door opening the other is a standard insert and turn. The turn indicators are little cheap, plastic inserts on sides though the rear view mirrors have a notch for the same. The cabin is drab and unimaginative. Anyone with an i20 experience will feel the difference. For its price it is highly underscored. Drive is fine though torque build up is poor. True to Honda petrol, the car has never given me any issues at all over the last 4.5 years. It has decent enough storage (400L + I think) and good for long drives. Overall solid, functional but completely unimaginative and low featured.
Honda;Jazz20182020;5 Aug 2020;Sandeep Singh;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am driving my Jazz since 2015 and even till now, it seems same feeling. Its been 4.5 years and i drove more than 80 thousand KM . but believe me, drive quality, comfort, glass view are really good. On the highway, we get 20+ average ( need to drive below 100) and in city its 18 KMPL( with A/C) . The maintenance cost is coming around 8 to 9 thousand. So after 4.5 year i can say that i am a proude owner of such a reliable car.
Honda;Jazz20182020;26 Feb 2020;Kishore Varma;5.0; Daily Commute ;This is my first car, 5 years now. Style : its a JAZZ OrangeSafety : 5*Comfort : have just one issue, bumpy on bad roads for back seaters, that suspension [ but i switched to michelin energy mx2 80% problem solved ], wondering why they are not stock. Mileage : 12kmpl city, 16-17kmpl highway with max speed 100 [without AC 19 kmpl], cost is a premium, but you get what you pay. I am satisfied custome r.thank you honda ..!
Honda;Jazz20182020;28 Mar 2019;Ashwin Thakare;3.3; Family Car ;A good family car. Always loved Honda Jazz. Good on space and comfort. Engine is super refined. The ivtec is silent and works like a charm. The missing rear seat head rests and magic seats on the top VX CVT trim is really disappointing. Still the love for Jazz mad me go ahead with it and own one. Mileage in city is around 10 to 11 kmpl as Jazz drinks fuel handsomely. However out on the highway it returns a decent 15 to 16 kmpl. I just did it"s second free service and it"s 3000 kms run on board. So far it"s good except the mileage in the city which could be a lil more. Overall I would give it 3.5/5. A good overall purchase.
Honda;Jazz20182020;24 Sep 2018;Laksh Gupta;1.0; Daily Commute ;I will suggest never buy a Honda car instead go for Baleno or any other car from different company never buy this car.. Tyres of new car just run 200kms are getting burst and company is least bothered. No customer service.. They just need money. Dakshin honda and honda cars india have cheated me. Very disappointed and will never ask anyone to be a prey of their trap. I cannot use my cars at high s peeds fearing tyre burst.. Very bad response and no solution for the customer. Received tyres with a buldge which will burst if driven fast. Very bad totally unacceptable
Honda;Jazz20182020;30 Aug 2018;Jatin Bhagat;2.0; Daily Commute ;Honda is the worst compared to Maruti and Hyundai. I have a maruti car and a hyundai car. My buying experience was thrashed with 6 months old car and 2 different purchase dates i.e. 31-March-2018 and 21-July-2018. When I bought the car on 21-July-2018. And, Honda still protecting its dealer and taking 15 days to respond. With Maruti and Hyundai, the customer is most important. With Honda, the cust omer is secondary. So, I would not recommend any honda car because of Honda car India customer service and customer centricity.
Honda;Jazz20182020;17 Dec 2019;Vinod Suthar;3.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I have been driving Jazz X since August 2012. When I purchased it, it was a good-featured car, being top-end version, although it is lacking power and torque required. Now with cars like XUV300, Jazz seems to be too poor in terms of features as well as power.
Honda;Jazz20182020;16 Aug 2020;A S;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car ;4.5 overall rating for Jazz. Mileage and speed to be better, interiors can be improved further. My personal point of view, but saying this will also say that the car is very comfortable in all sense, spacious and truly a family car
Honda;Jazz20182020;25 Aug 2019;Nikhil Sreek..;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;One among the best premium hatches that are available . There is Power for power and is very huge compared to its rival. Mostly under rated , the car seems to glide over the rood . too much space and a very good car all together.
Honda;Jazz20182020;10 Jun 2020;Sundarapandi..;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car;.Except ground clearance issue, i don't have any problems with my Jazz VX CVT for daily use.

Honda;Jazz20182020;18 Jul 2019;Phenomenal W..;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Brilliant vehicle. The engine is so silent and smooth sometimes I end up turning it off when its in on mode in traffic. Great features like cruise control makes highway driving a breeze. Steering has all controls including gear for manual mode driving. Good infotainment system with IoS and android connectivity, in built navigational maps. Mileage around 10-11 in city and 20 in highway.
Honda;Jazz20182020;5 Aug 2019;Pradeep Rana;4.7; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The car is exceptionally smooth in ride quality. You may feel not punchy in first gear but this is really for a smooth ride and you will enjoy the punch from 2nd to every next gear.Average - 15-17kmpl in all conditions. AC is very effective. Excellent car in the mountains. No comparison to the cabin space and comfort. Visibility is excellent.

It is the best hatchback and even Maruti's S-Cross is also good and is almost the same but if you ask me to choose between S-Cross and Jazz I would choose Honda Jazz.
Honda;Jazz20182020;31 Jan 2019;Deepu J;5.0; Daily Commute ;Honda Jazz is the one of the best premium hatch back. It is better than baleno and i20. I am using this for 4 yrs now.

Honda;Jazz20182020;23 May 2020;Prajwal J;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The best hatchback that I have ever owned. writing my personal experience being a passionate but not so sporty rider. Flashback : I would own Grand i10 ( 2013- 2016)- Comfortable best suspension systems, no noise cabin , Swift Zxi (2011 - 2013), superbly powered as it is named. other than this I had driven Figo which gave me a sense of comfortable driving ( in 2010). Now: After all above cars and with thorough review against all cars. I ended up hitting Jazz- V CVT. The reason behind this compact sedans are not my choice, and mid size segment were out of my budget. Let me tell you now this is one the best package available in India. The only thing I would miss in Jazz is 16" alloys. (others are fulfilled in later versions ans AVN, Cruse ctrl, button start etc). though , with 15" alloys the car gives smooth like butter driving experience on the highway and hassle free and j**k free drive in city & traffic. mileage maintenance etc are as normal as other brands available in India. my longest drive of ~ 2000KMs tour once a year and regular office commute of ~20KMs in this car has been fabulous so far. Verdict: If you are looking for a Daily Commute,Family Car, Tours with your family of 4. you shouldn't think of any other car than Jazz... Now new car buyers will get attractions viz., AVN, sunroof, cruse ctr, security locking etc. which we missed about 4year ago. so now it will be a fully loaded family package for you without any regrets in the segment.
