MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;26 Sep 2020;Kajal Singh;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;This is my first ever Car. I've been driving Delta variant and the experience is amazing. The only obstacle was running over potholes that could be easily felt. The car is light weighted within this range as compared to I-20 which is why it shakes a little when it's running over 80 or 100kpmh. Overall experience is smooth. Features and other alerts are good. Handling is pretty easy, speakers are n ormal. Dent is really common with maruti cars because of its average built quality though it doesn't give you that feel at all. Baleno gives you equal comfort and styling inside out. Dashboard looks cool and adjustable stearing is an add on. Spacious leg room. The design is apt at this price. I myself have opted for Baleno over swift and I20. Price is the major factor that beats I20 the difference is over 1lac with similar offerings.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;4 Nov 2020;Ananth Kumar;3.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car;I bought a ZETA petrol 2019 APRIL, it's been 20 months now still unable to login Suzuki connect, somehow data entry guy's made some mistakes so still I couldn't access full potential of my vehicles ease of convenience which I bought but couldn't use it, it's waste of money, after sales Service was a joke on this issue, rest is ok, can be go on easy, you paid for it but you couldn't use it that's a nnoying yaar, made so many calls & service's still my issue isn't resolvedüò°, I won't recommend, look for similar other options available not in Suzuki ofcourse.. stay safe drive safe.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;27 Aug 2020;Chinmay Panda;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Love the car as it is, awesome performance, comfortable enough, mileage wise also good. Entertainment system is also good. Sitting capacity is also enough, leg space is also gives you a fantastic feeling, only issue is in the suspension is quite stiff you will feel it while you are on a rough road. Car is very steady even you are on 120 speed. Breaking system could have improved a bit. More over s tyle wise means overall look wise you won't feel out dated, it always looks freash..to summarise it, the car is value for your money , you won't get disappointed if you are planning to buy it.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;30 Oct 2020;Vadish verma;3.7; Daily Commute ;My sister recently bought the maruti baleno delta 'base' variant in august.The car looks very premium inside out, And despite being a base model we have dual airbags, Seat belt reminder, Speed reminder etc.We also get a 12 v charging socket, Leather upholstery, An aftermarket pioneer touchscreen infotainment system, Etc too.There are ample amount of bottle holding spaces in every door, Decent amou nt of boot space and nice space at the rear seat.What not really good in this car is it's safety, Which remains standing at 2 stars.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;30 May 2020;Denny Devassy;5.0; Family Car;It's a beautiful car and stands to the classification of being a premium hatch back.. True ambient feel inside the cabin.. Best for a family of upto 5 as all 5 can fit without any space shortage.. Love every bit of my car.. Service delivery team is supportive and manage the customer relations well (showroom from where I bought my car, so this is personal comment). Words won't be enough so let me w rap up saying the best premium hatch back I have driven so far..
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;5 Dec 2019;Dharitri Devi;4.0; Family Car;Really a fuel efficient car i am getting a mileage of 15 in the city and almost 20 i the highways. Looks great its initial pickup is also better than i20. I have driven upto the speed of 150kmph. But it has some cons also...it doest feel stable after crossing 120. And the most important is its built quality which is very poor. Otherwise the car is awesome very spacious very reliable you must go fo r it
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;10 Dec 2020;Dipesh Prasad;2.7; Daily Commute ;Purchased baleno from kts nexa mumbai.Faulty vehicle delivered, Within first 2 months clutch and steering was replaced.Overall vehicle is quite spacious, Necessary features are available but interior plastic quality can be improved.Interior plastic doesn't feel premium at all.Don't purchase vehicle from kts nexa.They deliver faulty vehicles.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;8 Jun 2020;Pritpal Singh;4.7; Occasional Commute | Tours;I bought this car in and I'm happy with mileage performance but some time I feel I should not drive above 90 as this car doesn't giveme that confidence it feels light and brakes are light too. For city driveing it's good and low maintenance looks bold and it is spacious than other rivals in Premium hatchback.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;15 Dec 2020;Indranil Bha..;5.0; Family Car ;Best buy in range of 6 to 8 lakh, Good comfort, Big boot space, Huge leg room, Best economy in class, Better power delivery with respect to other hatchbacks, Well balanced car loved all hides in planes as well as hills.You can do moderate off roading also.Very low maintenance as a whole good car to have it.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;5 Sep 2020;Ricky Khatri;4.7; Daily Commute ;I have a baleno diesel but these guys don't have an option select diesel engine in baleno. Its running cost and maintainence cost is pretty low, feels like driving an activa. Just the headlamps are pretty expensive, as I have the alpha variant. So be careful for them if you're running the top spec model
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;30 Aug 2020;Santosh Meena;4.3; Daily Commute ;I have been using this car Since the car launched i.e Nov 2015, No maintenance cost, because loaded with all features, Nice Car with many Premium loaded features, build quality lower side, back seat also having lot of ample space, Boot Space pretty amazing, Average of 20-22 on highway and 15-18 in City
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;25 Feb 2020;Praan Agarwal;3.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Very great space everywhere you need in a executive hatchback .But rear seat has low thig support means very discomfort on long rides.Mileage is really decent. Safety features really mising .A lot of news is there related to accidents with Baleno - baleno - baleno . I feel i will change vehicle soon .
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;13 Aug 2020;Aman Agarwal;4.3; Tours ;The car is comfortable overall fun to drive but it only provide you with little power 88ps and upto100ps in rs model which is not enough when you are driving with 4 co passenger it's pick up is not good at all but overall if you are driving with 2 person or 3 it's really fun and responsive.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;6 Sep 2019;Jayanta Hand..;3.7; Family Car ;I have been driving baleno Zeta model petrol facelift from last 15 days, Everything is okay but the suspension and fuel consumption are not as I expected. I have swift dzire vxi petrol 2nd 2017 last old model, I think that one is very good for fuel consumption.. Always average 17 and above.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;26 Jun 2020;Ezra Matthew;4.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Generally good for local riding where no major collision or anything could be possible. If the whole body is weighty and strong enough to safeguard the travelling people, even though mileage should be less by 5 to 7 km per litre, Baleno would be the ruling master with riding confidence.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;14 Apr 2020;NAVEEN P;4.3; Family Car;it is vary stylish car and mileage is good compare to other cars in maruthi, when we dive in city ground clearance is the main problem in this car especially speed breakers touches the car and also back seat boot space is good suspension is some what problem for back seat passangers
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;3 Sep 2020;Nahush Kunte;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am using Baleno Zeta diesel since May 2017 and I have driven so far 56000 kms and I am really happy with the performance of the car. It has nice power and mileage and car is very stable on highways with speed of 120-130. I get around 24KMPL on highways and 20KMPL in city traffic.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;23 Aug 2020;Syril Sinken;5.0; Family Car ;Fantastic and marvelous ride ,much leg space, overall good shape and best in segments and also in interior and exterior of the car .The car 220km/per as its maximum speed .It has smart sensing ac and revere control.the radio has entirely different system from other cars in I India
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;26 Aug 2020;Ravi Teja;4.7; Family Car ;The looks of the car is excellent and spacious for 5 people, I have never faced any issue with Performance and braking, the best car one can own. The only thing to improve is build quality and the plastic quality apart from this its really excellent car, Happy Motoring to All
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;16 Nov 2019;Kumar Siva;5.0; Family Car ;Many said it was not a safe car for it's weight. But by all my experience it is more stable and it's breaking is more accurate when I compare it with my previous cars VW Polo and Swift. Baleno is also much better in comfort as compared to any relevant alternatives.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;11 Oct 2020;Aditya Chhetri;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;The bodywork feels okay at best, performance is satisfactory. The style is something which grows on you eventually, even though the back is just ugly. A lot of hard plastics, a sleek center console and great back seat space. 9/10 would recommend as a family car.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;6 Oct 2020;Thamizh Nesan;5.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;A superb car in this section. I really enjoy riding it. A/C is very cool and prompt to respond. Highway riding is extraordinary. I get a mileage of 24+. it's really impeccable for a Zeta Petrol variant. I've been using this car for more than two years.

MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;27 Sep 2019;Hariharapras..;3.0; Family Car ;As a first time owner of a car, I feel, features are less, seat comfort less, internal lighting very poor, external lighting below normal, ADD ONs poor, transmission good, body strength poor, should have been technically more advanced.
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;19 Dec 2019;Airwa Ayush;5.0; Family Car;I was going for Dzire but when I saw the BALENO then I compared its features with Dzire then I saw that there are so many features in BALENO then Dzire. It is so stylish hatchback with a lot of features. This is the SUPER CAR .
MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;28 Jun 2019;Lucky Rk;2.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Baleno is the best for adult. Very smoothly drive and normal mileage. Maruti suzuki servicing center for Manipur, Imphal - 795001 is very lazy and dull compare to the other car company servicing center.

MarutiSuzuki;Baleno;13 Oct 2020;Renjan Rajeev;4.3; Family Car ;Since I own a Baleno for 2 years, I would say it is the best choice for family users looking for practicality and economy but whereas if it was for Driver Enthusiast it is better to skip Maruti Suzuki in the segment.
