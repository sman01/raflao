Tata;Tiago;28 Nov 2020;Sreedutt V;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I had covered 130000kms (one lakh thirty thousand kms) in 4 years.I own tata tiago diesel.Its a 3 cyclinder revotorq engine its a quiet peppy engine but performs well.Its a very good car in this segment.All of us know about its saftery its a 4 star rated car.I purchased tiago for its fresh look and build quality.So far i did not faced any serious issues and i am happy with the after sales service also.So far so good.Its very fuel efficient motor which doesnt goes down below 19 in city use and will get around 24 to 25 in highways.I had taken to 150 kmph so its a performance oriented engine also.No big issues had faced broken ac vent sliders due to its plastic quality.But as we know tata is cheap for its parts changed it for 250 -350 around that only.Now i had changed my engine timming belt which cost me around 15000rs but now the car is in the excellent condition.I am sure i can use it upto 3 lakh without any engine problem.I guarantee you its worth the money you pay.And as we all know safety should be our main concerns.Beacuse in the car travelling with us is our loved ones.We get what we pay for tata motors.Trust me its not the old tata motors.I preffer tata motors in future also and i reffer to my loved ones.And be the vocal for the local.
Tata;Tiago;13 Feb 2020;Syam Nair;4.3; Daily Commute ;Compared to 2016 and 2017 make tiago, 2018 engines are more refined and fine tuned with no vibration, minimum engine noise, minimum cabin noise. Feature are superb - super sound Harmann musin system, mobile to car speaker blue tooth connectivity both for music, navigation and telephone connectivity. Premium looking car interior. Yesterday I had gone for a 55km + return on a six line highway with t rip meter B set to '0'. At 70/80/90 kms/h car was displaying 25km/l though when I checked trip meter A it was showing 15 km/l. I don't understand why there is a huge difference. If you want see 24km/l on your instrument cluster there is a way. After starting the car while it is moving set trip meter A and B to '0'. Let the trip meter B on your display which will show mileage of the current journey only. while keeping the speed 70-90 km/h your will see the mileage figure rose up to 25 - 27km/l which will shock you. i don't know whether it is actual.Anyway it is a good car with reasonable mileage, superb safety and superb features.
Tata;Tiago;5 Jul 2020;CHENNAI HEALTH;2.0; Daily Commute ;I am using Tata Tiago XZ for past 1 and half years, completed 30k KM, good for long drive and comfort. Coming to my complaints are, the day 1st I took my car from showroom I am facing this issues Unable to close the left side door, you need to give some extra pressure to close the door properly, I made a complaints 100 times they have checked many times but still I am facing the issue, the 2nd iss ue is after applying 2nd gear the car behaviour like some blockage I mean even though if you apply accelator car will not move it will block for some distance and go normally, this 2 issue for the last 1 and half years I am adjusting myself and running the car, I think this is manufactured defect, they have to solve this without delay, if the company not able to solve the issues, how we trust the product... Worst decision that I have bought Tata car....
Tata;Tiago;13 Jun 2020;Vinesh K;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Hi Friends l, My review about Tiago.One the best cars under 7 lakh section. I owned Tata tiago XZ 2020. Car ride quality is awsome. The quality of suspension is more than Hyundai i10 nios and suzuki swift cars. Look wise viewing angle is looks like a sporty hatchback.I found only con that due to three cylinder engine the gear knob is vibrating. Gear shifting is not smooth as Hyundai i10 nios and s wift cars. I feel that one is the only drawback other than it is awsome.Harman audio system is awesome XZ model had 4 speakers and 4 tweeters. Mileage wise I got 18 kmpl at Bangalore city and my 22 kmpl in highway.Safety wise as you all aware Global NCAP 4 star.Am totally satisfied about the car. I love my Tiago.Hope it helps you guys. Take care and safe riding.
Tata;Tiago;11 Feb 2020;Aleena Abin;1.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours;I bought a Tiago from tata. It became a biggest trouble in my life in the part of my money because the mileage which that car given for me is just 9km/ltr and the service cost which utilised fromme is lakhs and lakhs. Because my purchase of Tiago my dad had used an Alto 800 in that car we got high mileage and only less and low maintenance charges . The performance that car(Alto) had given for me w as really awesomebut Tiago it's really a worst car I ever driven the driveability is really too worst even the base entry level Alto 800 base Variant is much smoother than the 2017 Tiago so please don't go for wasting your money by buying Tiago it's really a bad car I am saying of from having experience on it
Tata;Tiago;26 Sep 2020;MUSICAL BROT..;4.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Everyone knows the safety offered by tata in tiago and all their other products . The highway mileage is 24 and city is 16.5 kmpl . The suspension is also excellent and on the softer side which absorbs all the bumps easily and can handle bad roads very easily . Rest there is only two negatives .1. No touchscreen system in 2019 XZ model (petrol) .2. The pickup decreases when ECO mode is on as the c ar then switches to 1000cc engine type and power output comes down from 85bhp to 70bhp only in order to take out good mileage .
Tata;Tiago;9 Mar 2020;Rama Krishna;5.0; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Overall it is very good car compared to other hatch back competitors like hyundai santro, i10, celerio, wagnor, kwid and swift. I can it is the best car when it comes to safety, build quality, performance and mileage (my amt xza car is giving 24-25 on highways). But only thing I've observed is little bit noise because tata comes with 3 cylinder. If it starts providing cars with 4 cylinder, then no other can compete with it (this is for sure which I can say0.
Tata;Tiago;25 Sep 2020;Ramanan RV;2.7; Family Car ;Tata Tiago is very Worst Car ever, Because we bought new car in 2016 first XT petrol model. Since 1000km to 2000km vehicle breakdown 5 times. very worst experience. once we went to some place then start the car it is not start, ohhh breakdown. once service provider check some small issue. but charge 1000Rs to 5000Rs. He told sensor locks and fuse issues. i am disappointed to bought this car. Very Worst Experience.
Tata;Tiago;15 Dec 2020;Beautiful Na..;3.3; Daily Commute ;Ye car tab tak safest hi jab tak aap ese tata ke body shop mi nahi le jate & ek bar agar body damage ho jaye or for aap en ke service center se body part change karwate hi to aap ke car safe nahi rahte for aap ko hamesa dar lage rahega because ye aap ke car ko ek dam bekar kar ke aap ko dete hi mere sath ye ho chuka hi.But its my last car for tata ab mi kavi tata use nahi karuga.
Tata;Tiago;1 Oct 2020;Prince PS;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Comfort is very satisfying.Overall driving experience is good. The over all performance is good. Excellent infotainment system.Lacks rear view/ parking camera.Low end pick up is disheartening.Mileage is satisfactory for a 1200 cc car.Built quality and the feeling of safety is excellent.Overall a quality mid segment car.
Tata;Tiago;29 Oct 2020;Ben Rois;4.3; Daily Commute ;Best car with 25 plus mileage assured.[tiago diesel] i love the car so much.The diesel variant gives more mileage than the petrol variant though.It is a fact that the car is having 'some' noise issue but considering the mileage, Safety and low maintenance cost its incomparable with any other car in the segment.
Tata;Tiago;13 Jun 2020;Dinesh Bopche;4.3; Family Car ;faulty gear box i am facing a reverse gear issue other wise a good and better safety while driving on highway its most beautiful and heavy vehicle as well as maintenance cost also minimum comfortable than maruti swift and grand i10. but. tata motors do work her reverse gear issue . very faulty gear box. very poor
Tata;Tiago;28 Jan 2020;Arun Nadig;4.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;Excellent car for a small family. Haven't driven too much in the city. But driven in highways a lot. can say mileage is pretty good getting around 19kmpl. But when it comes to power, generally desire for more and need to shift gears at lower speeds due to non availability of turbo. ps: Engine sound it bit high.
Tata;Tiago;22 Oct 2020;Jebu 001;2.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;Overall very good product in driving wise, decent mileage but tata has to work on mechanical glitches, lot of vibrations & rattle noice, flimsy plastic fit & finish, worst of them all this car engine jolts like something is stoping fuel supply in 2nd-3rd gear, which can result fatal if user is on highway.
Tata;Tiago;2 Jan 2021;Avadhut Sadhale;4.7; Family Car ;Zippy yet comfortable ride with feel of safety as well.Performance is good.Overall buid quality is excellent.small amount of cabin nose & minute vibrations probably of empty copassanger seat & parcel tray.After sales service is excellent.
