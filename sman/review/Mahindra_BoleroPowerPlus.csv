Mahindra;BoleroPowerPlus;20 Dec 2020;Vallinayagam S;4.7; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The engine is smooth, Strong build.Pickup is very solid.Mileage is very good.With good driving at a constant speed a mileage of 27 km per liter is achievable.It is very easy to drive through city traffic.Ample torque and clear view of the road makes you feel confident while driving.Good all purpose vehicle.I have driven it at high speed, It sticks to the road and gives good manuvaring.Service at a uthorised workshop is good.Overall, It is value for money.
Mahindra;BoleroPowerPlus;15 Dec 2020;Himanshi Bhavar;5.0; Family Car ;बोलेरो एक बहुत अच्छी गाड़ी है इसकी माइलेज बहुत ज्यादा और गाड़ियों से सबसे अच्छी है यह गाड़ी रोड की रानी है यह रिजर्व में कम से कम 60 किलोमीटर चल सकती है इस क� �� टंकी 60 लीटर की होती है

Mahindra;BoleroPowerPlus;27 Jul 2020;Sahil Sharma;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;Main purpose of this car for us is basically for apple season and its really best vehicle for the off road for carrying load in rainy season performance is good and most of people prefer this for hilly areas for carrying load
Mahindra;BoleroPowerPlus;30 Nov 2019;Jo;4.3; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;An all rounder from mahindra SUV yes,family car yes,govt car,yes police car ,yes..With decent off roading capacity and powerful engine for highways. On its own league. Never had a taxi badge.Can be parked like a maruti 800.
Mahindra;BoleroPowerPlus;5 Oct 2019;YARLAGADDA M..;2.0; Occasional Commute ;Worst customer service from the dealership, within 50000 kms worn-out the rear brake drums, clutch assy changed, recently AC not working and mechanic says condenser leaked that was total expenditure about Rs: 10000/-
Mahindra;BoleroPowerPlus;20 Dec 2018;Jebin Abraham;2.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Good looks from outside. Interior is old fashioned. Brakes are very bad. Parking in sloped surfaces could cause vehicle to roll. No braking confidence while driving. Midrow is unfoldable so can't load a lot of items.A small hatchback with seats folded can fit more stuff than bolero. Large turning radius very disadvantageous in cities. I would say spend little more n buy a good suv or muv than this .
