Tata;SafariStorme;6 Mar 2019;Anil J;5.0; Occasional Commute ;Tata like an aristocratic company don't do this, I brought my safari storm in 2014 march by the opening ceremony of M K Motors Kottayam, now Tata killed the legend, This year I planned to exchange my boy to Harrier or Hexa, both I test drove, but I can't get a smoothness or comfort or confidence in these vehicles, and also last month Auto car magazine it learn that Tata will kill hexa also by Apri l 2020.if i invested 24 lacs this year next year it will comedown as 5 lacs, So how we trust this company, in my view Tata cheating us.How we can by their vehicles for just one or two years, If they have a professional ethics, they will upgrade their Storm (Ratanji's flagship ) to automatic version. Now i have decided to retain my Safari Storm KL 03 X 8400, 29800km covered. But if i change it I will go for Ford Endevour. In my experience with storm /Safari last 12 years, I can't compare my safari to any Vehicles eg. Scorpio, Fortuner, XUV 5oo etc

Tata;SafariStorme;4 Jun 2019;Manjeet Bhargav;4.0; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;Tata Safari storme . A real SUV. Rough and tough . Real offroader. even without 4*4 its very capable. high seating position,wow. what a commanding position. seats are comfy and soft. Ride quality is best in class. best in class power and torque.better than scorpio. lots of space and it just glides over worst of worst road. tradition suv . i agree it doesn"t get new modern suv but i think it doesn" t matter for a safari lover. it fullfills out desires. i love it. Emotional Attachment with this beast.
