Hyundai;EON;10 Jun 2020;Vyshak Reghu..;3.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute ;For an 800cc car, this is a very good performer. However the mileage has taken quite a huge setback at about 11-12 kmpl. There is no RPM-meter which makes it tricky to get optimal performance. However the small size as well as the radical styling of this car is stupendous. Driving in small lanes is a breeze even when there is a huge truck coming towards you. For people living in rented places with no parking, this car is so easy to park in any corner of the building, road, etc. Parking at roadsides when making purchases and other daily activities make this an excellent daily car.It is unfortunate that Hyundai exited this segment, as well as never promoted this car as much as the i10/20s. They should've added more safety and security features to this car as well as regular updates.
Hyundai;EON;14 Jan 2020;Akash Mukherjee;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;This is my first car and i am very happy with it this car is excellent for daily commute as per the size of the car it is very easy to drive in heavy traffic in city . If i talk about front look this car is getting the signature fluidic design which every Hyundai car gets and it's is very easy to do some modifications with looks from the front side . Overall i am using this car since 3 years i nev er regret that whether i should oft for renault kwid Hyundai Eon engine is more superior than renault kwid (800cc) Interior design is also appealing to me if anyone think of buying used eon i am definitely going to recommend
Hyundai;EON;5 May 2020;Dr Mahesh;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car;Eon is a small family car and value for money. Driving experience is very good on highways but not a good car for Indian kaccha roads. It creates lot of suspension noise inside the cabin while driving on kaccha roads. The engine is very silent but when fully boarded with 5 seats it don't provide sufficient power to pull the car even after shifting to lower gears. Sometimes engine don't take the lo ad after gear shift..
Hyundai;EON;4 Mar 2020;Rohit Kapil;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours ;it's 814 cc engine is more punchy than 998cc engine of my wagon R. more comfortable very good breaking interior feeling like 7 lac segment car. low ground clearance gives very good driving pleasure. 2 times on the speed of approximately 80km hr accidentally took you turn and car slipped to you turn. lowered ground clearance helped me to slide like you turn without accident.thanks Hyundai.
Hyundai;EON;28 Aug 2019;Neel;3.7; Family Car ;It"s a great replacement for other small hatchbacks in its price range... Specially the main competitor Alto by Maruti Suzuki. Because it"s stylish, small, pocket friendly, reliable engine (because it"s Hyundai), and has every thing thing to offer that a middle class future car owner looks for in their first car.
Hyundai;EON;19 Aug 2020;Itishree Prusty;4.3; Family Car ;It is a nice car. It is a very low maintenance car. It needs very low maintenance for this car. It is an amazing car. I have bought this car on 2013 and it is dam nice till now. It's my favourite car. I will recommend you to buy this car , if you are looking a car in a budget of around 4-5 lacs.
Hyundai;EON;9 Mar 2020;Mahesh Ch;2.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;Nicely designed cute car. Good for city traffic with OK mileage. Am getting 13 to 14 in city and 19 to 20 in highways. I touched 130km of speed. Till 110 to 120 you will have good control. But quality is not so great. Maintenance will be of around 6k which is high for this segment of car

Hyundai;EON;23 Dec 2019;Rajneesh Pal;4.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;I am very satisfied with my Eon Magna +, which i purchased on Mar 2018. I drove it to Haridwar, Nainital, Delhi-Gurugram many times & it was really very reliable & comfortable.Only one thing is in mind that, as it discontinued, whether i should keep it or sell it ?
Hyundai;EON;4 Jun 2020;Harvinder Sh..;2.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;it has some pros..like interiors are really up to mark whereas cons are power side lacks when you on ac and boot space plius leg space needs needs some more interesting additions to make entry level car value for money. Overall happy with performance till date.
Hyundai;EON;22 Feb 2020;Soumya Subhra;4.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Tours ;if you love cars. it won't disappoint... even when you go on NH for hours....that too with a peak of 135kmhr that too rock solid road grip.... amazing car...Engine is amazing. though a 3 cylinder... typical. It's been 6 yrs.... still running smooth.
Hyundai;EON;1 Sep 2018;Shishir Mishra;4.0; Daily Commute | Tours ;Probably still the best looker in it's segment, with amazing interior fit and finish and those floating curves of fluidic design coupled with a 1000cc kappa motor with a tad throaty engine note than maruti makes me smile and it is still doing it. The best part is when people see my car and ask when did you buy and i say 3 years back, the give me a look filled with surprise as it still looks pretty neat and stylish - quality plus love!
Hyundai;EON;9 Jun 2020;Somsindhu Sen;3.7; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;It offers an excellent mileage along with a strong engine. Appears very cute as well. Just the disappointing thing is that it uses a beat cheap plastic for the front bumper which I think could made be of metal.
Hyundai;EON;13 Mar 2020;Amit Brahmbhatt;3.3; Occasional Commute | Family Car ;I am happy with overall performance but mileage is fluctuating like some time 16km and some time 20km. While running with AC on pickup of the car comes down 30% . So this car is good to drive without AC

Interior is best in class2. Handling is best even in tight roads can give confidence to drive it,thanks to EPS ....N that was not available in a step up cars when it entered .3.Descent milage4.Overall quality of the product is best.5.Service co st is also reasonable.6. Utilisation of space is done excellent in cabin7.Promising in this price tagScope for improvement1. ENGINE must have 1.2 2.rear suspension is far away from comfort3. As engine is small when use AC with pillion passengers even 5 people the performance drops drastically4. Lower variants why cost cutting is done don't know...?Eg.Wheel size is 12 inches so more bumps on rear side...How much had saved...😢Don't know5.
