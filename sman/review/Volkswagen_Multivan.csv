Volkswagen;Multivan;2 Aug 2019;Rich Tea;3.3; Family Car | Tours ;It is a vehicle for a job of work, is nicely made (rock solid) and with 205bhp it goes very nicely for a1 German "bread-van". So I rate it average as if an expensive car but it is not really a car at all. My model is actually a Transporter Kombi 1/2 van and 1/2 people carrier. It will glug it's fuel if you keep pressing the "go" pedal but if you back-off and use the cruse control it gets much bett er than 13 kmpl - your choice!
