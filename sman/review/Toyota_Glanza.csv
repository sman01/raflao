Toyota;Glanza;9 Jan 2021;Abhiraj Jit;4.3; Family Car;I have not owned the Toyota Glanza but had experienced this car through a test drive. Styling and comfort are great on the car and there are absolutely no complaints about the car. The seats of the car feel very wider and offers great comfort despite being a small car. Rear cabin does not feel claustrophobic which is appreciable. The build quality is something that can be better in order to justif y the Toyota badge as Toyota was safe and should remain safe. Interior quality is not very extraordinary and there are hard plastics. As a co-passenger, I noticed that the Chassis was light and there was a little bit bounciness which makes it feel being lighter. In terms of engine performance, the car did a great job due to less weight. According to my final verdict, I would say that this is better for short distances with families but not for highways or enthusiastic driving.
Toyota;Glanza;27 Nov 2020;Nitish Ramaraj;4.0; Daily Commute ;Toyota glanza more commonly known as the rebadged baleno.Well it's ok to get a baleno with the toyota support.A very comfortable car would never disappoint you.Performance is more than enough for daily city commute and occasional highway trips.Only downside is the mileage i get in city is not that great around 10 but on the highway i get 20.Other problems include the ground clearance problem some how i keep hitting it down to the speed breakers and yeah it's a pretty bad build quality, Just for a small crash the car gets damaged badly.Make a wise choice before getting this, Consider the other cars in the market now!üôÇ.
Toyota;Glanza;4 Oct 2020;Mohit Singh;3.8; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;The first question is why should you buy a glanza over a baleno then 1st. Cheaper (g hybrid and g variant ) 2nd lesser waiting period ,rest the car on its own is spacious, comfortable, fuel efficient, good for city runabout and the maintenance thanks to toyota e-60 service and app you get the exact amount you have to spend on the servicing of the car Tried to keep it short and simple hope should h elp
Toyota;Glanza;5 Dec 2020;Senthil Nathan;5.0; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute | Family Car | Tours;Very good car far better than Altroz performance, but when coming to build quality it's 2 step below than Altroz. -Altroz saftey car with awesome build quality-Glanza stylish Fun to drive car with decent build quality.

Toyota;Glanza;14 Jan 2021;Soumik Nag;4.2; Daily Commute | Occasional Commute;No car at this price can match with the features and comfort. I own the hybrid model and earn a fuel efficiency of 17 kmpl in city. Could have had a better built quality though.
