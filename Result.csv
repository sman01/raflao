13 Aug 2020;Abu Baba;3.7; Daily Commute | Tours;My diesel powered swift 2013 is probably the best hatchback car I have ever owned. The reason I say so is because even after driving it for more than 170000 kms, the car still feels fun to drive. Moreover it is an economic option with less service costs and average fuel economy I get of about 21 kmpl. Moreover Maruti's great after sales service experience, the quality of service/repairs offered an d vast network of service centers really helps. The only time I had to spend some money was in the events of tires and battery replacements. Although there are no high end features to brag about this car, the feature list is simply practical and just enough for a good driving experience. In my view, the only features this car must offer more is wider tires and cruise control. Also, Maruti should offer BS 6 diesel engines in new cars and if this happens, I think swift will be an even more fun to drive car."
