13 Aug 2020;Abu Baba;3.7; Daily Commute | Tours ;My diesel powered swift 2013 is probably the best hatchback car I have ever owned. The reason I say so is because even after driving it for more than 170000 kms, the car still feels fun to drive. Moreover it is an economic option with less service costs and average fuel economy I get of about 21 kmpl. Moreover Maruti's great after sales service experience, the quality of service/repairs offered an d vast network of service centers really helps. The only time I had to spend some money was in the events of tires and battery replacements. Although there are no high end features to brag about this car, the feature list is simply practical and just enough for a good driving experience. In my view, the only features this car must offer more is wider tires and cruise control. Also, Maruti should offer BS 6 diesel engines in new cars and if this happens, I think swift will be an even more fun to drive car."
5 Jun 2020;Paras Raizada;4.0; Daily Commute;I have clocked 260K KM's in last 10 years with 1.3L Petrol Engine. Just 1 clutch plate change @ 120K KM with tyre change @ every 80K KM's. Only 1 time front and back suspension change and other minor mechanical wear and tear changes. I cannot be happier than this that even after 10 years of life cycle, 260K KM's, its going strong and I believe will be able to clock anywhere around 400K Km's by nex t 2-3 years.I'm addicted to this car and unable to change to new one just because of sheer driving pleasure and ultra low cost maintenance.This car is just amazing......"
16 Apr 2020;Shriniket Punde;3.3; Daily Commute | Family Car | Tours ;The first gen swift is considered as one of the most fun to drive hatchbacks in India . My swift , dispite being a diesel, is no exception . It handles great, has a punchy mid range and decent braking too. The things which it misses-out on are most of the creature comforts which are found even in much cheaper car today. My Swift is a 2011 model year and still, the feature list dates back to the 90 's.I still love the car as it has a soul, a happy and energetic nature which is hard to find in cars now-a-days !"

It offers more features like push button start, automatic climate control, touchscreen infotainment system and also provides an fun to drive experience to its owners, the millege is phenomenal in this segment I think bcoz it offers 24km millege in highway. Overall it satisfies the all things for beginners. And safety features also implemented in this car ex...ABS, EBD, airbags such I preety excited about this factors of my swift"

9 Nov 2020;Deepu Pato;3.3; Family Car ;The overall car design and the rigidity are awesome but the problem arises with the safety where the maruti suzuki has not even given the rear parking sensors.The car is not so spacious and the maintenance cost is also so high as compared to the features and all if you ask me to buy this car or not then i will prefer you not to bu this because the car is not at all safe, And spacious.But if you wa nt a car which have a good mileage and a good design."

2 Jul 2020;Partha P;3.3; Daily Commute ;The Swift Vxi is reasonably sturdy, but the mileage is something that definitely should have been more. Mileage within the city is approximately 11 to 12 Kmpl and on long drives, it is approximately 16 Kmpl. Lack of airbags and other safety measures is a definite worry. But overall in terms of performance, it has been quite good. Smooth rides with no engine problem in the last six years."

6 Jun 2020;Raman Bhardwaj;4.7; Family Car ;I have spent wonderful 4 years with Maruti Suzuki swift ZXI. Driving it was always fascinating. I it was the easiest car to drive. I learnt driving on a old model 3 geared jeep. Then after much consideration I bought swift zxi. Easiest car to drive , no maintenance cost, easy smooth driving. While driving it you get a feel of sports car. Just amazing..."
1 Sep 2020;Pranav J;3.7; Daily Commute | Family Car ;The car is good for daily use as its economic and the maintenance is less. The suspension is not very good and ride comfort is average. On the highway its comfortable but hitting a pothole is a pain in the ass. I would not recommend for long ride since the build quality is below average . A small pressure even with your hand on the body causes a dent ."
